Lab 4A -- Programming C++ using Input redirect and data file
      </h1>
      </center>
<p>
Write a C++ program named <font color=red>"leapyear.cpp"</font>. 
This program reads the year values from a data file "years.dat"
 and determines wherhter the year is leap year or not.
The data file "years.dat" can be downloaded from the course web page.
Put the data file in the same folder/directory as the program. 

<p>
The data file contains year values, one value per line. Here is an example of the data:
<xmp>
1984
1345
2004
2015
1800
2021
1900
2000
2020
</xmp>
Your program reads in one year value, determines whether it is a leap year, output the result, and move on to process the next year value. 
Keep doing this until the end of the data file is reached.

<p>
An example program output for this data file is shown below:

<hr>
<xmp>
yes
no
yes
no
no
no
no
yes
yes
</xmp>
<hr>

<p>
Use a while loop to process the year values one by one til the end of the data file :
<xmp>

// this while loop will read the year value one at a time til the end of the data file is reached
while (cin >> year)
{
    // add code to process the year value here




}
</xmp>

<p>
Use input redirect to allow the program to read from the data file supplied from the Linux command line. 
Run the program with the input redirect command as the following:
<p>
<font color=red>a.out < years.data</font>
<p>
