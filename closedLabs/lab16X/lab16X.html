      <h1>
Defining Overloaded function(s) and Overloaded Operator(s) in C++ Classes
      </h1>
      </center>

<p>
In this lab, we learn to define overloaded functions and operators in a C++ Class. 
In particular, we will add the following 
to the <b>"dateClass"</b> defined in closed lab 16: <br>
(<b>Note: Add the new code directly to the programs developed in lab16. 
Do not create a new codelite project for this lab.</b>)
<ul>
<li><font color=red>Copy constructor</font>. In lab 16, we have already defined two constructors for the dateClass, 
namely the <b>default constructor</b> and the <b>value contructor</b>. 
The copy constructor is used where a new object of this class is created as 
a copy of another existing object. 
The existing object is passed in the copy constructor as a value parameter. And 
<li><font color=red>4 overloaded operators</font>:
    <ul>
	<li>The <font color=red>== operator</font> is used when comparing two dateClass objects: 
		the dateClass object "self" to the left of the <font color=red>== operator</font>, 
		and the dateClass object to the right of the operator. 
		It returns true if the "self" object represents the same date as the second object, and returns false otherwise.
	<li>The <font color=red>< operator</font> is used when comparing two dateClass objects: the dateClass object "self" to the
		left of the <font color=red>< operator</font> and the dateClass object to the right of the operator. 
         	It returns true if the "self" object represents the date prior to that of the second object, 
		and returns false otherwise.  <br>
		A date is prior to another date if : <br>
		<ul>
		<li>the first date's year is prior to that of the second date; 
		<li>the two dates have the same year value, and the first date's month is prior to that of the second date; or
		<li>the two dates have the same year and month values, and the first date's day is prior to that of the second date;
		</ul>
<!--
        <li>The overloaded pre-fix increment operator <font color=red>++</font>. When a dateClass Object is incremented using a pre-fix increment operator, its "day" value is incremented by 1. 
-->
	<li>The <font color=red>>> operator</font> is used to prompt the user to enter a date. The overloaded operator will prompt to read the month, day, and year values for the dateClass on the right side of the operator;
	<li>The <font color=red><< operator</font> is used to display the date in the format "Current Date: Month/day/year".
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>
You will need to modify both the specification file and the implementation file of the class "dateClass" to 
incorporate the declaration and definition of the new constructor and the overloaded operators.
<p>
<li>Next, modify the client program ("main.cpp") to test out these new additions: <br>
(<b>Note</b>: The steps in black color were coded in lab 16. The steps in blue color are new steps to be added)
<ol>
   <li>Declare an object named "firstDate" using the default constructor,
   <li>Declare a second object named "secondDate" using the value constructor, 
       	with month equals to 3, day equals to 15, year equals to 2019,
   <li>Change the date of the first object to month=7, day=17, year=2019,
   <font color=blue>
   <li>Use the <font color=red>overloaded << operator</font> to display the "first" dateClass object,
   <li>Write a C++ if-else statement to compare the first and the second dateClass object 
   	using the overloaded <font color=red>==</font> operator. If the two objects do not represent the same date, 
	output the message "Two different dates.", otherwise, output the message "Same date".
   <li>Declare the third dateClass object as a copy of the first dateClass object using the copy constructor,
   <li>Use the <font color=red>overloaded >> operator</font> to read the values for the "first" dateClass object,
   <li>Write a C++ if-else statement to compare the second and the third dateClass objects using the 
	<font color=red>overloaded  < operator</font>.
	If the second object represents the date prior to that of the third dateClass object, output the message: 
	"Second date is prior to the third date", 
	otherwise, output the message: "Second date is not prior to the third date".
</ol>
</font>
<p>
Create a makefile as shown below to compile your program:
(Makefile to use tab character in front of the lines starting with $(CC))
<xmp>
CC=c++
CFLAGS=-g

## Create the executable RunProg
lab16xRun:dateClass.o main.o
        $(CC) dateClass.o main.o -o lab16xRun

## Create the object file for the ADT dateClass
dateClass.o:dateClass.cpp
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c dateClass.cpp

main.o:main.cpp
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.cpp

clean:
        rm *.o
</xmp>
To compile the program, simply type "make" at the prompt. This will create the executable file
named lab16Run. Execute the program by typing "lab16Run".

<p>
<h2>What to Submit?</h2>
For this lab, you need to submit these files: <b>dateClass.h, dateClass.cpp, main.cpp, and lab16xlog</b>.
<p>
Create the log file as the folowing:
<br>
<xmp>
script lab16xlog
pr -n -e4 dateClass.h
pr -n -e4 dateClass.cpp
pr -n -e4 main.cpp
pr makefile
make      <-- compile the program and generate the executable file
lab16xRun   <-- run the program
exit
</xmp>
<p>
Handin the program with the following command: <p>
<font color=red>handin lab16x dateclass.h dateclass.cpp main.cpp lab16xlog</font>
<p>
