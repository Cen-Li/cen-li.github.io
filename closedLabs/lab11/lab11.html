      <h1>
Programming C++ using <em>Linear Search </em> with One Dimensional Array
      </h1>
      </center>

<p>
In this assignment, we will practice using <font color=red>Linear Search</font> 
for a problem.
<p>
Steps for programming:
<ul>
<li>Write a C++ program named <font color=red>books.cpp</font>;
<p>
<li>Copy the data file <b>booktitles.dat</b> into your project directory.
</ul>

What to include in <b>"books.cpp"</b> program:
<ol>
<li>The program reads the titles of a collection of books
from a data file and stores them in an array. <br>
This should be done using a <font color=red>User defined function named "ReadData"</font>.
This function should have 3 parameters: 
 <ul>
 <li>the input file stream, 
 <li>the array of book titles, and
 <li>the number of books read from the file.
 </ul> 
<li>Then, the program <font color=red>sorts the titles in alphabetical order </font>(use <b>bubble sort</b>) 
and prints out the list of book titles, one title per line,
<li>Afterwards, the program goes into a query mode prompting the user to query whether a book is in the collection. If the book is in the collection, it display its location in the collection. If the book is not in the collection, inform the user about that. The query mode ends when the usr enters an empty string, i.e., simply press the "ENTER" key when prompted for book title.
</ol>
<p>
<font color=blue>Notice: The index of the first element in the array
is 0. Yet, for the output, the value corresponding to the first book should be 1. 
Same goes for the location values returned in the query mode.</font>

Enter the book title: Ruby
The book is at location 9

Enter the book title: The Plum Tree
The book is at location 20

Enter the book title: While I Was Gone
The book is at location 27

Enter the book title: Harry Potter
The book is not in the collection.

Enter the book title: The Dragon Maker
The book is not in the collection.

<font color=blue>You may use the Linear Search code discussed in class:</font>
<xmp>
int LinearSearch(string names[], int size, string toFind)
{
   int position = -1;
   bool found=false;
   int index;

   index=0;
   while (!found && index < size)
   {
       if (names[index] == toFind)
       {
           found = true;
           position = index;
       }

       index++;
   }

   return position;
}
