      <h1>
Lab 10 -- Programming C++ using <em>Linear Search </em> and <em>Selection Sort</em>
      </h1>
      </center>

<p>
In this lab, we will learn how to apply <font color=red>Search</font> 
and <font color=red>Sort</font> techniques learned in class to solve application problems.
<ul>
<li>First, create a new project. (This creates the project directory under the codelite workspace directory)
<li>Then, copy the data file into the project directory. You can use 'cd' commands to navigate to the project directory, i.e., cd  codelite/closedLab9.
Now, copy the data file <font color=red>booktitles.dat</font> with the command:
<font color="red">cp ~cen/data/booktitles.dat .</font>
</ul>

Write a C++ program, named <b>"books.cpp"</b>:
<ol>
<li>The program reads the titles of a collection of books
from a data file and stores them in an array. <br>
<li>Then, the program sorts the book titles alphabetically in ascending order,
<li>Once sorted, the program prints out the list of book titles, one title per line,
<li>Afterwards, the program goes into a query mode prompting the user to query whether a book is in the collection. If the book is in the collection, it display its location in the collection. If the book is not in the collection, inform the user about that. The query mode ends when the usr enters an empty string, i.e., simply press the "ENTER" key when prompted for book title.
</ol>
<p>
<font color=blue>Notice: The index of the first element in the array
is 0. Yet, for the output, the value corresponding to the first book should be 1. 
Same goes for the location values returned in the query mode.</font>
<br>

Here is an example run of the program:

<xmp>
Books sorted in alphabetically ascending order:

1 : A Bend in the Road
2 : A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose
3 : A Spool of Blue Thread: A novel
4 : Cane River
5 : Drowning Ruth: A Novel
6 : I Know This Much Is True: A Novel
7 : Middlesex: A Novel
8 : Night (Night)
9 : Ruby
10 : Shantaram: A Novel
11 : She's Come Undone
12 : Take Me With You
13 : The Alchemist
14 : The Book of Awakening: Having the Life You Want by Being Present to the Life You Have
15 : The Gifts of Imperfection: Let Go of Who You Think You're Supposed to Be and Embrace Who You Are
16 : The Invention of Wings
17 : The Life We Bury
18 : The Nightingale
19 : The Pecan Man
20 : The Plum Tree
21 : The Secret Life of Bees
22 : The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself
23 : We Are Water: A Novel (P.S.)
24 : What I Know For Sure
25 : What She Left Behind
26 : When I Found You
27 : While I Was Gone
28 : Whistling Past the Graveyard
29 : Yellow Crocus

Enter the book title: Ruby
The book is at location 9

Enter the book title: The Plum Tree
The book is at location 20

Enter the book title: While I Was Gone
The book is at location 27

Enter the book title: Harry Potter
The book is not in the collection.

Enter the book title: The Dragon Maker
The book is not in the collection.

Enter the book title: Take Me With You
The book is at location 12

Enter the book title:

The Search and Sort functions:
<xmp>
int LinearSearch (const string a[], int aSize, string toFind)
{
     // Look through all items, starting at the front.
     for (int i = 0; i < aSize; i++) {
         if (a[i] == toFind)
             return i;
     }

     // You've gone through the whole list without success.
     return -1;
}

void SelectionSort(string arr[], int n) 
{

      int i, j, minIndex;
      string tmp;

      // repeat pair-wise comparison across the elements n-1 times
      for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) 
      {

        // find the index of the element with the smallest value in the remaining elements
            minIndex = i;
            for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++)  {
                  if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex])
                        minIndex = j;
            }

            if (minIndex != i) {

            // swap arr[i] and arr[minIndex]
                  tmp = arr[i];
                  arr[i] = arr[minIndex];
                  arr[minIndex] = tmp;
            }
      }
}

<h2>What to Submit?</h2>
For this lab, you need to submit one file: <em>books.cpp</em>.

<p>
<h2>Steps to edit, compile, run, and submit the program:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If after you compile your program, there is compilation errors, then you need to modify the program according to the error messages. 
You may need to edit and compile your program multiple times before it compiles successfully.

<li>Now you can run the program, check to make sure the output is correct. If not, you need to modify the program and recompile and rerun the program.

<li>Once you are able to successfully run the program with the correct outputs, you are ready to submit the program electronically. Only submit the source file. 

Locate the source file in your "project" directory under your "workspae" directory. 
For example, if you named your "workspace" as "codelite" under your home directory, and named the project "cla10", then "books.cpp" should be in ~/codelite/cla10 directory.
