      <h1>
Lab 6 -- Programming C++ with <em>C++ type string </em> and <em>its functions</em>
      </h1>
      </center>

<p>
In this lab, we will practice:
<ul>
<li> Program with C++ type string, its methods (built-in functions defined for C++ type string)
and the getline function. 
<li> Simple operations with one dimensional array.
</ul>
You will write two C++ programs. 
Two seperate projects need to be created, one for each problem. 
Create the second project after you have finished programming for the first problem.
<p>

<h2>Program One</h2>
Write a C++ program, named <b>"count.cpp"</b>, that counts and reports 
the number of words in a line of text entered by the user.
Assume the text only contains words separated by single space. <p>
Here are a few example runs of the program:
<hr>

<p> Sample run 1:
<xmp>
Please enter a line of text: 
The baby smiles as soon as she wakes up.

There are 9 words in this sentence.
</xmp>
<p>
Sample run 2:
<xmp>
Please enter a line of text: 
Tom and Jerry are lovely characters.

There are 6 words in this sentence.
</xmp>
<p>
Sample run 3:
<xmp>
Please enter a line of text: 
The Labor day weekend passed so quickly.

There are 7 words in this sentence.
</xmp>
<hr>

<h2>Program Two</h2>
Write a C++ program named <b>"capitalize.cpp"</b>.
In the program, your program reads in a line of text. 
It capitalizes the first letter of each word in the text.
<hr>
 Sample run 1:
<xmp>
Enter text:  You need to think hard when playing the think game. 
Modified text:  You Need To Think Hard When Playing The Think Game. 
</xmp>
<p>
Sample run 2:
<xmp>
Enter text: Tom thinks Jerry is an annoying mouse.
Modified text: Tom Thinks Jerry Is An Annoying Mouse.
</xmp>
<hr>

<!--
Write a C++ program named <b>"replace.cpp"</b>.
In the program, your program reads in a line of text. 
It replaces every appearance of the word <b>"think"</b> with the word <b>"answer"</b> in the text.

<hr>
<p> Sample run 1

<xmp>
Enter text:  You need to think hard when playing the think game. 
Modified text:  You need to answer hard when playing the answer game. 
</xmp>

<xmp>
Sample run 2

Enter text: Tom thinks Jerry should be a great thinker.
Modified text: Tom answers Jerry should be a great answerer.
</xmp>
-->

<p>
For this lab, you need to submit two files: <b>count.cpp</b> and <b>capitalize.cpp</b>.
<p>
<h2> Steps to edit, compile, run, and submit the program:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If after you compile your program, there is compilation errors, then you need to modify the program according to the error messages. 
You may need to edit and compile your program multiple times before it compiles successfully.

<li>Now you can run the program, check to make sure the output is correct. If not, you need to modify the program and recompile and rerun the program.

<li>Once you are able to successfully run the program with the correct outputs, you are ready to submit the program electronically. Only submit the source file. 

Locate the source file in your "project" directory under your "workspae" directory. 
For example, if you named your "workspace" as "codelite" under your home directory, 
and named the project "cla6", then "count.cpp" should be in ~/codelite/cla6 directory.
