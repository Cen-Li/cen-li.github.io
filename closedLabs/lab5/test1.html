Test 1 programming problem (25 pts + bonus)
      </h1>
      </center>

<p>
This is the programming problem for test 1.  You are not allowed to ask others or GTA for help. 
The program should be completed by one individually.
<p>

<h2>Program Description</h2>
Write a C++ program, named <font color=red>"count.cpp"</font>, that counts and reports 
the number of words in a line of text entered by the user.
There are a few special notes about the program:
<ul>
<li>Your program should have a value returning function named "CountWords" that takes as input a string type parameter, and returns the number of words in the string as the function's return value.

<li>The user may enter an empty line of text, i.e., just press enter when prompted. 
Your program should report 0 words in this case.

<li> There may be one or more white spaces in between pairs of words. 
Your program should skip over these white spaces in thtt case.

<li> <font color=blue>You are required to use C++ string functions in developing this program.</font>
</ul>
<p>
Here are a few example runs of the program:
<hr>

<p> Sample run 1:
<xmp>
Please enter a line of text: 
The baby smiles as soon as she wakes up.

There are 9 words in this sentence.
</xmp>
<p>
Sample run 2:
<xmp>
Please enter a line of text: 
Tom    and      Jerry are lovely characters.

There are 6 words in this sentence.
</xmp>
<p>
Sample run 3:
<xmp>
Please enter a line of text: 


There is 0 word in this sentence.
</xmp>
<hr>

<p>

<h2>Bonus (5 pts)</H2>
In addition to counting the number of words in the sentence, find and display the number of 
occurrences of the word "the" in the sentence, for example:
<hr>
Sample run 4:
<xmp>
Please enter a line of text: 
The amount of attention received by the article is astonishing.

There are 10 words in the sentence.
The word occurred 2 times in the sentence.
</xmp>
Sample run 5:
<xmp>
Please enter a line of text: 
Tom    and      Jerry are lovely characters.

There are 6 words in this sentence.
The word occurred 0 times in the sentence.
</xmp>
<p>
Your program should be written in such a way that the word to look for can be easily switched to another word. 
That is, do not hard code the program to look for the specific word "the". Use a variable named "wordToCount" 
of string type, and search for this word in the sentence.
