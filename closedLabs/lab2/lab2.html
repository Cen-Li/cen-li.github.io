<h2>The programming problem</h2>
Write a C++ program named <font color=red>"invest.cpp"</font> that computes the total anticipated future value of the investment at the end of the years allotted. 
the future amount may be computed using the formula shown below. 
<br>
<img src="invest.jpg">
<p>
The program prompts the user to enter :
<ul>
<li>P: the principle amount of the investment, 
<li>r: the interest rate,
<li>n: the number of times interest is compounded per year (1 or 12),
<li>t: number of years of the investment.
</ul>
Your program computes and displays the future value of the investment.

Once you finished writing your program, compile and run the program.

<br><P>
Here is an example run of the program:

<hr>
<xmp>
Welcome to the investment helper!

Enter principle amount of your investment : $ 2500
Enter the interest rate: 6.5
Enter the number of times interest is compounded per year: 12
Enter the number of years of this investment: 10

Your investment of $2500 will grow into $4780.44  at the end of 10 years.

</xmp>


<br><P>
Here is another example run of the program:

<hr>
<xmp>
Welcome to the investment helper!

Enter principle amount of your investment : $ 3000
Enter the interest rate: 4.5
Enter the number of times interest is compounded per year: 12
Enter the number of years of this investment: 20

Your investment of $3000 will grow into $7366.34  at the end of 20 years.
</xmp>
<h2>Submit the program:</h2>
Create a script file that capture the outputs of your program.
<xmp>
script  log2
pr -n -t -e4 invest.cpp
g++ invest.cpp -o run
run
run
run
run
exit
</xmp>
<p>
These steps creates the script file named log2. <br><p>
<ul>

<p>
<b>For this lab, submit the following two files: invest.cpp and log2. </b>
</ul>
