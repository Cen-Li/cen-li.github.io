Lab 21 -- Circular Doubly Sorted Linked List with Dummy Head
      </h1>
      </center>


<p>
In this lab, we will practice coding one type of linked list variation: the Circular Doubly Linked List with Dummy Head. The list is to be maintained in sorted (ascending) order. 
The advantages of this linked list variation include :
<ol>
<li> When coding for "insertion" and "deletion", there is no need to differentiate between the two cases: (1) insert/delete at the beginning of the list; (2) insert/delete at the middle or end of the list
<li> For maintaining a sorted list, only one temporary pointer "cur" is needed to locate the insertion/deletion location and to perform the insertion/deletion operation.
</ol>
<p>

This program reads in a number of string type values from a data file 
and inserts the items into the list maintaining the sorted order of the list after each item is inserted.

The format of the data file is as the following:

<xmp>
apple 
pineapple
orange
milk
...
</xmp>

Your program will read the items frwm the data file one at a time and inserts the item into the list. It repeats 
these read-insert steps til the end of the data file is reached.
The content of the sorted list after each read-insert step is as following:
<ul> 
<li>When the list is first created, an empty circular doubly linked list with dummy head is: head<->dummy-head-node (and dummy->next points to dummy; dummy->precede points to dummy.)
<li>After the first item "apple" is read, the list content is head<->dummy<->apple<->dummy. (apple->next points to dummy, dummy->precede points to apple)
<li>After the item "pineapple" is read, the list is : head<->dummy<->apple<->pineapple<->dummy. (pineapple->next points to dummy, dummy->precede points to pineapple)
<li>After the item "orange" is read, the list is : head<->dummy<->apple<->orange<->pineapple<->dummy. 
<li>After the item "milk" is read, the list is : head<->dummy<->apple<->milk<->orange<->pineapple<->dummy. 
</ul>
<p>
Copy the data file using the following command: 
<xmp>
cp ~cen/data/produce.dat  workspace-directory/project-directory/.
</xmp>

<p>
We are not going to use a C++ class for this lab.
The linked list will be developed entirely in the client program. 

<p>
Write a client program with the following components:

<xmp>
// fill in the blank area 
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cassert>
using namespace std;

typedef string ListItemType;

struct Node {
   Node * precede;
   ListItemType data;
   Node * next;
};
typedef Node * NodePtr;

// Declare the function "BuildSortedList" here


// Declare the function "InitializeDummyHead" here


// Declare the function "PrintForward" here


// Declare the function "PrintBackward" here


// Declare the function "DestroyList" here


int main()
{
    ifstream myIn;
    NodePtr  head;  
    
    myIn.open("../produce.dat");
    assert(myIn);

    // call function "InitializeDummyHead" to create and initialize the dummy head of the list


    // call function "BuildList" to read data from the data file and  
    // construct the circular doubly linked list with dummy head


    // call function "PrintForward" to display the list in the forward order


    // call function "PrintBackward" to display the list in the backward order


    // call function "DestroyList" here

    myIn.close();

    return 0;
}

// define the function "InitializeDummyHead" here 
// This function dynamically allocate space for the head node
// and assigns both the "precede" and the "next" fields of the node to point to itself




// define the function "BuildSortedList"  here
// Write a "while" loop to read the items from the data file one by one.
// In the body of the loop, for each item read, insert it into the doubly linked circular list with dummy head
// The list should be maintained in the sorted order after each data is inserted.
// The loop terminates when the end of the data file is reached.




// define the function "PrintForward" here 
// This function prints out the items in the list in the order as they appear in the list




// define the function "PrintBackward" here 
// This function prints out the items in the list in the reverse order as they appear in the list




// define the function "DestroyList"  here
// This function de-allocates the memory of all the nodes of the list.
// After all the memory is released back to the heap, it assigns NULL as 
// the value of "head" 




</xmp>

<p>
Here  is an example output from the program run:
<xmp>
Printing forward:

apple
banana
bread
cake
candy
chips
egg
icecream
milk
onion
pepper

Printing backward:

pepper
onion
milk
icecream
egg
chips
candy
cake
bread
banana
apple
</xmp>

For this lab, you need to submit one file: <em>main.cpp</em>.
<p>
<h2>Steps to edit, compile, run, and submit the program:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If after you compile your program, there is compilation errors, then you need to modify the program according to the error messages. 
You may need to edit and compile your program multiple times before it compiles successfully.

<li>Now you can run the program, check to make sure the output is correct. If not, you need to modify the program and recompile and rerun the program.

<li>Once you are able to successfully run the program with the correct outputs, you are ready to submit the program electronically. Only submit the source file. 

Locate the source file in your "project" directory under your "workspace" directory. 
For example, if you named your "workspace" as "codelite" under your home directory, and named the project "cla21", then "main.cpp" should be in ~/codelite/cla21 directory.
