Lab 20 -- Sorted Linked List
      </h1>
      </center>


<p>
In this lab, we will practice coding sorted linked list. 
We are not going to use a C++ class for this lab.
The linked list will be developed entirely in the client program. 
<p>

This program reads in a number of values from the data file and inserts the items into a sorted list in alphabetical order.
The format of the data file is as the following:

<xmp>
apple 
pineapple
orange
milk
...
</xmp>

Your program will read the items from the data file one at a time and inserts the item into the list. It repeats 
these read-insert steps til the end of the data file is reached.
The content of the sorted list after each read-insert step is as following:
<ul> 
<li>After the first item "apple" is read, the list content is head->apple.
<li>After the item "pineapple" is read, the list is : head->apple->pineapple.
<li>After the item "orange" is read, the list is : head->apple->orange->pineapple.
<li>After the item "milk" is read, the list is : head->apple->milk->orange->pineapple.
</ul>
<p>
Copy the data file using the following command: 
<xmp>
cp ~cen/data/produce.dat  workspace-directory/project-directory/.
</xmp>


<p>
Write a client program with the following components:

<xmp>
// fill in the blank area 
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cassert>
using namespace std;

typedef string ListItemType;

struct Node {
   ListItemType data;
   Node * next;
};
typedef Node * NodePtr;

// Declare the function "BuildSortedList" here


// Declare the function "SortedListInsert" here


// Declare the function "DisplayList" here


// Declare the function "DestroyList" here



int main()
{
    ifstream myIn;
    NodePtr  head;  
    
    myIn.open("../produce.dat");
    assert(myIn);

    // call function "BuildSortedList" to read data from the data file and  
    // construct the list


    // call function "DisplayList" to display the list


    // call function "DestroyList" here



    return 0;
}

// define the function "BuildSortedList" below
// Write a "while" loop to read position-item pairs from the data file.
// insert the item into the list at the specified position. Call "SortedListInsert" function for insertion.
// The loop terminates when the end of the data file is reached.


// define the function "SortedListInsert" below



// define the function "DisplayList" below



// define the function "DestroyList" below




</xmp>

For this lab, you need to submit one file: <em>main.cpp</em>.
<p>
<h2>Steps to edit, compile, run, and submit the program:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If after you compile your program, there is compilation errors, then you need to modify the program according to the error messages. 
You may need to edit and compile your program multiple times before it compiles successfully.

<li>Now you can run the program, check to make sure the output is correct. If not, you need to modify the program and recompile and rerun the program.

<li>Once you are able to successfully run the program with the correct outputs, you are ready to submit the program electronically. Only submit the source file. 

Locate the source file in your "project" directory under your "workspace" directory. 
For example, if you named your "workspace" as "codelite" under your home directory, and named the project "cla19", then "main.cpp" should be in ~/codelite/cla20 directory.
