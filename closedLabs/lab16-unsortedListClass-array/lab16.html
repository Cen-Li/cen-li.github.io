Lab 16 -- Unsorted List Class with Array Implementation
      </h1>
      </center>


<p>
In this lab, we will practice adding methods to List class and using the List Class in a client program.
<p>
You can copy the current list class (list.h and list.cpp) 
into your account using the command:<br>
<b>cp ~cen/data/list.*   workspace-folder/project-folder/. </b> <br>
(this command will copy both the list.h and list.cpp files into your directory).
Copy/paste the list.h and list.cpp content into your current project.
<p>
Now, add the following 2 methods to the list class. 
Make sure to add the appropriate code in both the 
header file (list.h) and the specification file (list.cpp):
<ul>
<li><font color=red>the copy constructor</font>: this constructor will create a new object of the list class and initialize its values:
<ul>
<li> this list object will have the same values in its array as that of the object passedin as parameter
<li> this list object will have the same array size value as that of the object passed in as parameter
</ul>

<li><font color=red>AddAtFront</font> method: add an item of the listItemType at the front of the list. The item to be added is supplied by the client program. If the list is already full, this operation can not be carried out. Display an error message in this case.

<li><font color=red>DeleteAll</font> method: this method will delete 
<font color=red>ALL</font> the occurrences of a value (of listItemType) in the list. The value to be deleted is supplied by the client program. <font color=blue>Display a message indicating how many occurrences of the value were deleted.</font>
</ul>
<p>
To clear the end-of-file character ^d from the input stream, use the function call:
<font color=red>cin.clear();</font>
<p>

Write a client program with the following statements:

<xmp>
// fill in the blank area 
#include "list.h"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Declare the function "BuildList" here


// Declare the function "DisplayList" here


int main()
{
    // use the default constructor to declare a List class object named "list1"


    // call the function "BuildList" to build the list "list1". The function prompts the user to enter a number of values and insert them into the list


    // call the function  "Display" to display the values in "list1"
    

    // use the copy constructor to declare a second List class object named "list2". "list2" is created as a copy of the object "list1"



    // Prompt the user to enter an item/value to be deleted from the list "list2"
    // use "DeleteAll" method to delete all the occurrence of that value in "list2"



    // call the function  "Display" to display the values in "list2"



    return 0;
}

// define the function "BuildList" below
// Write a "while" loop to read a number of values one by one from the user.
// After a value is read, add the value to the front of the list by applying the "AddAtFront" method.
// The loop terminates when the end of file '^d' ('^d' is the end of file character. It is achieved by pressing the CTRL key and 'd' key together) is detected.
//
// Requirement:  you are required to use the method "AddAtFront" in defining this function
//
// For testing purposes, enter these numbers:
//                     20  30  20  10 5 20 ^d



// define the function "DisplayList" below
// The function displays the values in the list one value per line

// Requirements: you are required to use the methods "GetNextItem" and "Reset" 
//               in defining this function


</xmp>

<p><h2>Example output of the program:</h2>
<xmp>
Enter a value (^d to stop):
20
30
20
10
20
5

6 values in the list:
5
20
10
20
30
20

Enter value to delete : 20

3 occurrences of value: 20 deleted.
After deleting, the list of values are:
3 values in the list:
5
10
30
</xmp>
<p>
<h2>What to Submit?</h2>
For this lab, you need to submit three files: <em>list.h, list.cpp, main.cpp</em>.
<p>
<h2>Steps to edit, compile, run, and submit the program:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If after you compile your program, there is compilation errors, then you need to modify the program according to the error messages. 
You may need to edit and compile your program multiple times before it compiles successfully.

<li>Now you can run the program, check to make sure the output is correct. If not, you need to modify the program and recompile and rerun the program.

<li>Once you are able to successfully run the program with the correct outputs, you are ready to submit the program electronically. Only submit the source file. 

Locate the source file in your "project" directory under your "workspace" directory. 
For example, if you named your "workspace" as "codelite" under your home directory, and named the project "cla16", then the 3 files should be in ~/codelite/cla16 directory.
