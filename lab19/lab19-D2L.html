      Lab 19 - Stack Application
      </h1>
      </center>

<p>
In this lab, we use the STL container "Stack" for an application.
The characteristic of a Stack is : "Last In First Out". 
<p>
The STL stack method include:
<ul>
<li><font color=red>pop</font>: Remove the top element
<li><font color=red>push</font>: Insert the next element
<li><font color=red>top</font>: Access the next element
<li><font color=red>size</font>: Return size
<li><font color=red>empty</font>: Return whether the container is empty
</ul>
Here is a link to the stack class description on cplusplus.com:
<a href=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack/>link to C++ stack container</a>.
<p>

Write a program that will allow the user to evaluate postfix expressions. 
A postfix expression is an arithmetic expression where the operator occurs after the expression. 
For example, using infix notation we would add 4 and 5 using 4 + 5. 
In postfix notation we would arrange the operator to occur at the end: 4 5 +. 
A postfix expression can become arbitrarily complex such as 3 4 5 + - 2 *. 
This expression would be expressed using infix notation like this: (3 - (4+5)) * 2. 
As you can see, the postfix form does not require parentheses because the order 
of operations is made explicit. It turns out that evaluating postfix expressions 
is quite easy when combined with a stack data structure.  
<p>
We read a postfix expression from left to right pushing values onto the 
stack when a number is encountered and popping numbers from the stack 
when an operator is encountered. 
For example, the expression 4 5 + would require the following operations:
<ol>
<li>Push 4 onto the stack
<li>Push 5 onto the stack
<li>Pop the top two values of the stack, add them, and then push the result back onto the stack.
  <ol>
  <li>first pop operation will pop <font color=blue>operand 2</font>, i.e., op2 is 5
  <li>first pop operation will pop <font color=blue>operand 1</font>, i.e., op1 is 4
  <li>apply the operator between these two operands in the sequence: <font color=blue>op1 + op2</font>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>
Your program should support the basic arithmetic binary 
operators such as +, -, *, and / for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

You can test your program with these postfix and their expected results:

<xmp>
Postfix					Result

3 4 5 + - 2 *				-12
10 20 2 * + 5 /				10
20 10 / 2 * 5 + 			9
10 2 8 * + 3 -				23
10 2 * 8 - 3 -				9
</xmp>


<p>If you would like your program to be able to work with expressions having
arbitrary number of spaces in between operands/operators, you may use 
a function like this:
<xmp>
void SkipSpaces()
{
    char ch=cin.peek();
    while (ch == ' ') {
        ch=cin.get();
        ch=cin.peek();
    }
}
</xmp
<p>
Name the program <font color=red>postfix.cpp</font>. When you are done with programming and testing the program, submit the program electronically to the D2L dropbox for this closed lab. 
<p>

For this lab, you need to submit one file: <em>postfix.cpp</em>.
<p>
<h2>Steps to edit, compile, run, and submit the program:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If after you compile your program, there is compilation errors, then you need to modify the program according to the error messages. 
You may need to edit and compile your program multiple times before it compiles successfully.

<li>Now you can run the program, check to make sure the output is correct. If not, you need to modify the program and recompile and rerun the program.

<li>Once you are able to successfully run the program with the correct outputs, you are ready to submit the program electronically. Only submit the source file. 

Locate the source file in your "project" directory under your "workspace" directory. 
For example, if you named your "workspace" as "codelite" under your home directory, 
and named the project "cla19", then "postfix.cpp" should be in ~/codelite/cla19 directory.
