Programming C++ with <em>Two Dimensional Array</em> 
      </h1>
      </center>

In this lab, we write a program that plays the tic-tac-toe game.
The game board of a tic tac toe game is a 3 by 3 (two dimensional) array of character type.
An example game of tic-tac-toe is shown in the "Example Output" section.
You can copy the skeleton program ttt.cpp to start the project: <b> cp ~cen/data/ttt.cpp workspace/project/. </b>.
<xmp>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int SIZE=3;
// declare all the functions here

int main()
{
   char turn;
   int x, y;
   char gameBoard[SIZE][SIZE];

   // Call the function InitializeBoard to Initialize the game board pieces to blanks
   InitializeBoard(gameBoard);

   // Randomly determine who is to start the game
   int t=rand()%2;
   if (t == 1)
        turn='X';
   else
        turn='O';
   cout << "Game Starts!" << endl;

   // Display the initial game board on screen
   Display(gameBoard);

   // The game is played between two players until one of two cases occurs:
   // (1) the board is completely filled with pieces from the player, and no winner is determined. 
   // (2) one player wins the game
   while (!BoardIsFull(gameBoard)&& (CheckWon(gameBoard)=='n'))
   {
   	// Prompt the player to enter the position to play the next move
	// The move is validated in the inner loop. 
	// Only if a move is valid, it will be assigned to the gameboard
       do
       {
          do {
          cout << "Player " << turn << " makes the next move."<<endl;
          cout << "Enter the x, y location, 0<=x<3, 0<=y<3:";
          cin >> x >> y;
          } while (x>2 || x<0 || y>2 || y<0);
       }
       while (!Assign(gameBoard, x, y, turn));
       // The Assign function will attempt to assign a move from a player to the gameboard. IF there is already a piece at that location, Assign function will not put the piece at that location and it returns false. Otherwise, it will put the piece at that location and return true. 

	// Show the updated game board
       Display(gameBoard);

	// determines the player for the next move
       if (turn == 'X')
           turn = 'O';
       else
           turn = 'X';
   }

   // Display the result of the game
   if (CheckWon(gameBoard) == 'X')
      cout << "Player X wins!" << endl;
   else if (CheckWon(gameBoard) == 'O')
      cout << "Player O wins!" << endl;
   else
      cout << "This is a Draw game!" << endl;

    return 0;
}

// This function initializes all the elements of the game board to blank characters ' '
void InitializeBoard(char gameBoard [][SIZE])
{

}

// This function displays the game board as a 3 by 3 board
void Display(char gameBoard[][SIZE])
{

}

// This function checks to see if all the elements of the game board have been filled
bool BoardIsFull(char gameBoard[][SIZE])
{

}

// This function assigns character p to location (x, y) on the game board
// p is either 'X' or 'O'
// If the location (x, y) already has a piece/character there, do not assign p to that location, returns the boolean value false
// If the location (x, y) does not have any piece/character, assign p to that location and return true
bool Assign(char gameBoard[][SIZE], int x, int y, char p)
{

}

// check to see if the game is over by checking
// if any row, column or diagonal has the same character
// if 'X' is on all elements of a row, column, or diagonal, 'X' is returned
// if 'O' is ............................................., 'O' is returned
// otherwise, 'n' is returned.
char CheckWon(char gameBoard[][SIZE])
{
    char won = 'n';

    // write multiway if statement to check whether a win condition is met
    // Case 1: the 3 elements on the i-th row of the array are the same, assign the array element value to variable "won" 
    // Case 2: the 3 elements on the j-th column of the array are the same, assign value to variable "won" 
    // Case 3: the 3 elements on the diagonal of the array are the same, assign value to variable "won"
    // Case 4: the 3 elements of the second diagonal of the array are the same, assign value to variable "won"

    return won;
}

<b>Special Requirements</b>
You are required to complete the following four functions:
<ul>
<li> InitializeBoard: This function initialize all the elements of the game board to blanks ' '
<li> Display: This function displays the game board as a 3 by 3 board
<li> BoardIsFull: This function checks to see if all the elements of the game board have been filled
<li>Assign: This function assigns character p to location (x, y) on the game board p is either 'X' or 'O'
<li>CheckWon: This function checks to see if the game is over by checking if any row, column or diagonal has the same character.  If 'X' is on all elements of a row, column, or diagonal, 'X' is returned.  If 'O' is ............................................., 'O' is returned.  Otherwise, 'n' is returned.
</ul>

Here is an example output of the program:

<p>
For this lab, you need to submit one file: <em>ttt.cpp</em>.
<p>
<h2>Steps to edit, compile, run, and submit the program:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If after you compile your program, there is compilation errors, then you need to modify the program according to the error messages. 
You may need to edit and compile your program multiple times before it compiles successfully.

<li>Now you can run the program, check to make sure the output is correct. If not, you need to modify the program and recompile and rerun the program.

<li>Once you are able to successfully run the program with the correct outputs, you are ready to submit the program electronically. Only submit the source file. 

Locate the source file in your "project" directory under your "workspace" directory. 
For example, if you named your "workspace" as "codelite" under your home directory, and named the project "cla14", then "ttt.cpp" should be in ~/codelite/cla14 directory.

<p>
Submit the program with the command:
<br> <font color=red> handin lab14 ttt.cpp </font>
