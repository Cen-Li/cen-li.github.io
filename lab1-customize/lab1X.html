<P>
<B>ON DOING CLOSED LABS:</B>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="red">Read everything!</FONT>
Careful reading of the closed lab instructions is a must.
You simply cannot delve into a lab and start typing.
Unlike a verbose textbook where you can often skim over material,
labs are much shorter and almost everything written is important.
Read the material
and, only where and when directed, enter commands.
Be patient, both with yourself and with the lab material---remember,
you are a beginner at this stuff and it will take a while to
become proficient.
<HR SIZE=3>

<P>
<BR>
<B>EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVE:</B>
Earlier, you customized your <B><I>ranger</I></B> course computer account
in <A HREF="https://cs.mtsu.edu/~untch/manual/labZ1/lab1.html">
Closed Lab 1</A>.
(Remember, this summer <B><I>ranger</I></B> really only refers
to <B><I>ranger<FONT COLOR="green">2</FONT></I></B>.)
You are now ready to use <B><I>ranger</I></B> to do some work.
The exercises below will give you a brief introduction to 
accessing the <B>Xfce</B> desktop via <B>NX</B>
and let you practice entering a few <B>UNIX</B> commands
and using some of the <B>Xfce</B> features.


<P>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR=red>STEP 1.</FONT>
LOG ON USING THE <I>X2Go CLIENT</I>:</B>
We will be using a UNIX <B>Desktop</B> environment
for the exercises below.
(Unlike in any specific version of Windows
where there is typically only one standard desktop environment,
there are several possible UNIX Desktop environments.
The one we will be using this semester is called
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce"</A><b>Xfce</b></A>.)
Although we will again connect to <B><I>ranger</I></B>,
we will do it a bit differently---instead of using <B>PuTTy</B>,
we will use a program installed on the lab PC you are using
that is called the <I>X2Go Client</I>.
To connect to <I>ranger</I> via the <I>X2Go Client</I>,
double-click the mouse on the reddish <B><I>X2Go ranger</I></B> icon
that looks like this one in the upper right-hand corner of the screen shot:
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="X2Go-ranger.png" ALT="X2Go ranger">
</CENTER>

<P>
<u>Make sure the icon has the label
<b><i>X2Go&nbsp;ranger</i></b></u>!
When you double-click on the icon,
you should get an X2Go login window.
Unfortunately the screen resolution left from the previous
user might be the wrong value.  Dismiss the login window by
pressing <B>Esc</B>cape and you'll get the following selection window.

<center>
      <img src="X2GoSelection.png" WIDTH=75%>
</center>
<P>
The third drop-down item under ranger2 should say "Display 1".
If it doesn't, open the menu and select that entry.  Be sure
the rest of the values in that window say the same things as
in the sample image above.  When everything is set, click
the window and you'll again get an X2Go login window like the following:
<center>
      <img src="X2GoLogin.png" WIDTH=75%>
</center>
<P>
Use your <I>course account</I> information to access <I>ranger</I>.  
Inside the <FONT SIZE="+2"><tt>Login</tt></FONT> text box area
enter your course account's <I>C-number</I>
(that is, the 8&nbsp;character login <I>username</I> you were assigned;
for example, c1003534). 
In the <FONT SIZE="+2"><tt>Password</tt></FONT> text box area,
enter your course account's <I>password</I>; for example 74ab2w45.
Your password will not be displayed
but will echo as a row of dots or asterisks, such as "********",
so be careful in your typing. 

<P>
After filling in the requested information,
click the <tt>Ok</tt> button and after a few seconds 
a full-screen window should appear (as depicted below).
We call this the <B><i>UNIX&nbsp;Desktop</i></B> window.
(Actually, because you are on an upgraded system, YOUR desktop
will look slightly different.)
<P>
    <center>
      <img src="CustomizedXfceRoot.png" WIDTH=50%>
    </center> 
<P>
<I>Note: 
If you are unsuccessful after several attempts,
check to be sure the <b>Caps Lock</b> key is not locked 
on the keyboard. If it is, unlock it and try again.
Otherwise, ask the lab assistant for help.</I>

<P>
It may take a few seconds for the <i>UNIX&nbsp;Desktop</i> to appear
and your window may temporarily be dark before finally fully displaying.
This larger window with a (I dunno, what color would you call it?) background
shows that your PC is properly connected to the
<i>ranger</i> system. 
If you cannot get the <i>UNIX&nbsp;Desktop</i> window to appear,
then ask a lab assistant for help.

<B><FONT COLOR=red>STEP 2.</FONT>
USING the Iceweasel browser:</B>
Once you have an active <I>UNIX&nbsp;Desktop</I>,
you will open up the <B>Iceweasel</B> browser.
<B>Iceweasel</B> is just another name for <B>Firefox</B>.
Find the standard <B>Firefox</B> icon on the desktop and double-click it.
Using the <B>Iceweasel</B> browser (NOT this browser that you are
reading these instructions on!), browse to the page
<B>https://cs.mtsu.edu/~untch/1170/private/honesty.txt</B>
and read, print, sign, and hand in to the lab instructor the
<I>Academic Honesty in the Context of CSCI 1170/2170</I>.
<FONT COLOR=red><B>
&nbsp;
(NOTE: To access password-protected course Web pages, such as this one,
use "MT" for the User name field and "CS" for the password; no
quotation marks.)
</B></FONT>
&nbsp;
Print to the (default) <B>cs360</B> laser printer.
After you have retrieved your printout, close the <B>Iceweasel</B> browser.

-->
<P>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR=red>STEP 2.</FONT>
USING the Chromium browser:</B>
Next open up the <B>Chromium</B> browser.
<B>Chromium</B> is just another name for Google's <B>Chrome</B> browser.
Move your mouse to the <B>Chrome/Chromium</B> icon on the desk top
and double-click the <B>Chromium</B> icon that appears there.
<FONT COLOR=red>
<B>Observation: icons on the top toolbar are activated by single-clicking
but the icons on the desktop are activated by double-clicking.</B>
</FONT>
The arrow in this next screenshot points to the <B>Chromium</B> icon:
    <center>
      <img src="XfceChromium.png" WIDTH=50%> 
    </center> 
Using the <B>Chromium</B> browser (again, NOT this browser that you are
reading these instructions on), browse to the page
<B>https://cs.mtsu.edu/~cen/2170/index.html</B>
and print and submit the <I>Syntax Comparison between Python vs. C++</I> page.
The print out will be printed to the (default) <B>cs360</B> laser printer
and turn the printed form in to the lab assistant.
After you have retrieved your printout, close the <B>Chromium</B> browser.

<P>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR=red>STEP 3.</FONT>
GETTING A TERMINAL WINDOW: </B>
When you are done with STEP 3, you will open a <I>Terminal</I> window
on your <I>UNIX&nbsp;Desktop</I>.

<P>
There are several ways to open up a <I>Terminal</I> window.
The easiest is to double-click on the big desktop <B>Terminal</B> icon that,
on a customized account, is usually located in the lower left hand corner
of the <I>UNIX&nbsp;Desktop</I>. 
Alternatively, if the desktop Terminal icon is missing,
you can move your mouse to the top toolbar 
and single-click the tiny <B>Terminal</B> icon that appears there.
The arrows in this next screenshot point to these
 two <B>Terminal</B> icons:
    <center>
      <img src="XfceTerminalIcon.png" WIDTH=50%> 
    </center> 


<P>
Either way, you should now have a <I>Terminal</I> window
on your UNIX&nbsp;Desktop.  (See picture below.)
You can move windows and arrange them as you like.
To move a window, click the left mouse button on the title bar of the window,
hold it down and drag the window into position.
To make a window active, move the mouse on to that window.
<B>Focus follows mouse</B>; you do not need to click.  If you move the mouse off
that window to another window (other than the big blue desktop space) it
will change which window is active.
<BR>
    <center>
      <img src="XfceWithTerminal.png" WIDTH=50%> 
    </center> 

<P>
<B>USING THE TERMINAL WINDOW:</B>
Much of UNIX is "command&nbsp;driven"; that's a fancy way of saying
that to get most things done, you type out command instructions 
inside a <I>Terminal</I> window instead of clicking on icons.
UNIX is <I>case-sensitive</I>,
that is, it distinguishes between upper and lower case letters.
It is important to type the commands exactly as indicated.
Failing to put in a space where required is an error; however
when a space is required, the amount of space (i.e., the number of blanks)
is usually not critical.
<P>
The default <I>Terminal</I> window size is 24 rows long and 80 columns wide;
that is what we usually want it to be.
You can resize a window by placing the mouse over the 
top or side window edge, then click the left mouse button, hold and drag. 
Although the <I>Terminal</I> window can be resized,
it MUST be at least 24 rows long and 80 columns wide.
Any smaller than these minimum dimensions and certain commands get messed up.
You can check the current size of your window by entering
the following UNIX command, do so:
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>stty&nbsp;&nbsp;size</B></FONT>
<BR>
(Do NOT enter the dollar sign as part of your
command. It is meant to represent the prompt provided by the system.) 
This will display the number of rows followed by the column width.
If the window is too small, resize it larger.

<p>
<B><FONT COLOR=red>STEP 4.</FONT>
Starting Codelite in a Terminal</B>
To start a codelite session, simply type "codelite" in a terminal, as shown below:
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>codelite</B></FONT>
<BR>

Your next lab has detailed instruction on how to proceed with C++ programming within codelite. 
Follow the instructions carefully. It is important that you setup codelite correctly at the beginning.
<!--
<P>
<B>A GLIMPSE AT THE PAST:</B>
Before <B>rur</B> and the <I>Reeborg</I> robot, we used to use
another "robot" to teach programming in this course--<I>Karel</I>.
Just to get a flavor of what that was like, let's
try running the Karel <B>maze</B> program located in <B>$PUB</B>.
Issue the command
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT>&nbsp;<FONT FACE=Verdana COLOR=blue><B>$PUB/maze&nbsp;&nbsp;$PUB/maze.wor</B></FONT>
<BR>
(Don't get confused in typing this command in. Although you don't enter
the red dollar sign, the blue dollar sign is part of the command
and must be typed.)
If all went well, you should have a screen that looks
something like the following:
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="/~untch/karel/images/MazeExample.jpg"             ALT ="maze">
</CENTER>

<BR>
When a Karel program executes successfully, it creates a report file.
Assuming the <B>maze</B> program execution was successful above,
issuing the following command
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT>&nbsp;<FONT FACE=Verdana COLOR=blue><B>cat&nbsp;&nbsp;maze.wor.rpt</B></FONT>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
will display the report file on your monitor.  Go ahead and do so.
The displayed output should look like this:
<FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="brown">

<P>
Don't worry about interpreting this report.
Although you can probably figure out some of it on your own,
the only reason we produced this report is so that we'd have
a file to display using the
<FONT FACE=Verdana COLOR=blue><B>cat</B></FONT> command.
For now, the important thing is that you were able to display the report.
If you were unable to access the report, or if anything else did not
work as you expected, ask the lab instructor for help.

<P>
After having displayed the report. let's get rid of the report file;
we don't need it any longer.  Issuing the following command
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT>&nbsp;<FONT FACE=Verdana COLOR=blue><B>rm&nbsp;&nbsp;maze.wor.rpt</B></FONT>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
will permanently erase (remove) this report file.  Go ahead and do so.

<P>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR=red>STEP 5.</FONT>
A LITTLE BIT OF UNIX and PRINTING A FILE:</B>
&nbsp;
By following the steps below, you will be able to navigate
into a directory (folder) that will contain your closed lab files
and learn how to invoke the <B>rur</B> environment.

<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Closed lab files and such are stored in the the <B>CLA</B> directory.
The <B>CLA</B> directory was automatically created for you
when you customized your account.
A directory is essentially a folder where a collection of files is stored.
To enter the <B>CLA</B> directory,
you would issue the command
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>cd&nbsp;&nbsp;CLA</B></FONT>
<BR>
to make the <B>CLA</B> directory your current working directory.
Go ahead and enter the command.
(Last reminder:  Do NOT enter the dollar sign as part of your command.
It is meant to represent the prompt provided by the system.)
&nbsp;
<I>Observation:</I> By now you may have noticed that most UNIX commands,
including this one, are <I>silent</I> when they work correctly.
Thus you will not get any confirmation that you successfully
changed directories---it will simply happen and you'll get another
system prompt.

<P>
Once you are in the <B>CLA</B> directory, you can continue with the next step.

<P>
<LI>
Let's copy a file into the <B>CLA</B> directory, enter the command
     <BR>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
     <FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>cp $CLA/shortwalk.py shortwalk.py</B></FONT>
     <BR>
The copy command is another example of a UNIX command that is <I>silent</I>
when it works correctly.  So if you got some message from typing this
command, it's probably the system complaining you did something wrong.
Try again.  If necessary, raise your hand and the lab assistant will
assist you.

<P>
<LI>
To see what is in the <B>CLA</B> directory, enter the command
     <BR>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
     <FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>ls</B></FONT>
     <BR>

You should see one entry:
&nbsp;
<B>shortwalk.py</B>
&nbsp;

<P>
<!--
<LI>
Now let's invoke the <B>rur</B> environment so we can
&nbsp; (A) put in our own name in the comments on the program and
&nbsp; (B) run the program. Enter the command
that follows (complete with trailing ampersand):
     <BR>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
     <FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>rur shortwalk.py &</B></FONT>
     <BR>

If all goes well, you should now have an <B>rur</B> window that looks like:
<BR>
    <center>
      <img src="rurShortwalk.png" WIDTH=50%> 
    </center> 

The left hand panel of the <B>rur</B> window is a <I>notepad</I>-like editor.
Change <FONT color="green">student name</FONT> to your own name.
The <FONT color="green">student name</FONT> field appears TWICE in the
comments; be sure you change BOTH of them.
Once you have made these two sets of changes, 
save the file by clicking on the
<I>Saves robot program</I> <IMG SRC="save_program.png"> button
on the <B>rur</B> window title bar.
Next run the program by clicking the green run
<IMG SRC="run1.png"> button.

Exit <B>rur</B> by clicking on the
close <IMG SRC="close4.gif"> button on that window's title bar.

<P>
<LI>
You need to create a hardcopy printout of the <B>shortwalk.py</B> file.
<FONT size="+2" color="red">
<U>Hand&nbsp;in&nbsp;this&nbsp;hardcopy.</U>
</FONT>
Don't forget to label the printout with the five lines of 
information requested in
<A HREF="/~untch/1170/labinfo.html#SUBMISSION">handout #2</A>
(see section "<B>CLA Submission</B>".)
The command
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>lph&nbsp;&nbsp;shortwalk.py</B></FONT>
     <BR>
will print the file on the laser printer in KOM 360.
<P>
<LI>
You will also electronically submit the program source; 
use the following UNIX command to do this:
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>
handin "lab1X"  shortwalk.py
</B></FONT>

     <BR>
     <BR>
Because this is the first time you are using the
<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>handin</B></FONT>
command, you will get a message of the form:
<PRE>
NOTE: Please enter your course account's password when prompted.
(Use your instructor-supplied course account password.)

Password for 'c8******':
</PRE>
Enter your course account password (the same one you used to log on to ranger)
as indicated.
<FONT COLOR="green">
&nbsp;
On the newer ranger systems, your password will be obscured by a
row of asterisks.
On the older ranger systems,
don't be alarmed that nothing seems to be being entered;
your password will <b>not</b> be shown on the screen as you type it,
not even as a row of asterisks.  It is going in, however!
</FONT>
<BR> 
(You may also be asked if you'd like to
<CODE>Store&nbsp;password&nbsp;unencrypted&nbsp;(yes/no)?</CODE>;
&nbsp;
if asked, answer &nbsp;
<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue>
<B><CODE>yes</CODE></B></FONT>.)
<BR> 
This will be the only time you will need to provide
this information for <FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>handin</B></FONT>;
the information is stored for future uses.
<BR> 
If successful, this <FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>handin</B></FONT>
command will deposit a copy of the specified file in an electronic repository.
<P>
<LI>
-->
<p>
Once you are done, you should close your terminal window by entering
<FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>exit</B></FONT>
and then logging off <I>ranger</I>
by closing your <B><i>UNIX&nbsp;Desktop</i></B>.
To log out, click the green (running person) <i>Quit</i> icon
on the far right of the menu bar.
