      <h1>
Lab 5 -- Programming C++ with <em>C++ type string </em> and <em>its functions</em>
      </h1>
      </center>

<p>
In this lab, we will practice:
programming with C++ type string, its methods (built-in functions defined for C++ type string)
and the getline function. 

Write a C++ program, named <font color=red>"count.cpp"</font>, that counts and reports 
the number of words in a line of text entered by the user.
Assume the text only contains words separated by single space. <p>

<font color=red>You are required to use C++ string functions for this problem</font>.
<p>
Here are a few example runs of the program:
<hr>

<p> Sample run 1:
<xmp>
Please enter a line of text: 
The baby smiles as soon as she wakes up.

There are 9 words in this sentence.
</xmp>
<p>
Sample run 2:
<xmp>
Please enter a line of text: 
Tom and Jerry are lovely characters.

There are 6 words in this sentence.
</xmp>
<p>
Sample run 3:
<xmp>
Please enter a line of text: 
The Labor day weekend passed so quickly.

There are 7 words in this sentence.
</xmp>
<hr>

<!--
Write a C++ program named <b>"replace.cpp"</b>.
In the program, your program reads in a line of text. 
It replaces every appearance of the word <b>"think"</b> with the word <b>"answer"</b> in the text.

<hr>
<p> Sample run 1

<xmp>
Enter text:  You need to think hard when playing the think game. 
Modified text:  You need to answer hard when playing the answer game. 
</xmp>

<xmp>
Sample run 2

Enter text: Tom thinks Jerry should be a great thinker.
Modified text: Tom answers Jerry should be a great answerer.
</xmp>
