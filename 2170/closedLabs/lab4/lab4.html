Lab 4 -- Programming C++ using while Statements
      </h1>
      </center>

<p>
In this lab, you will write two C++ programs to solve two problems. Two seperate projects need to be created, one for each problem. Create the second project after you have finished programming for the first problem.
<p>

<h2>Programming Problem One</h2>
Write a C++ program, named <font color=red>"average.cpp"</font>, that reads all the values from a data file, display the values and computes the average of these values.

<p>
Here is an example run of the program:

<p> Sample run 1
<xmp>
The values read are:
30
40
25
64
89
103
45
89
34
24
15
63

Total 12 numbers. The average of these values is 51.75.

</xmp>
<hr>


<h2>Programming Problem two</h2>

Write a C++ program named <font color=red>"coin.cpp"</font>
that simulates flipping a coin repeatedly and continues until
three consecutive heads are tossed. At that point, your program should display the total
number of coin flips that were made. Use rand() function to simulate random toss of the coin.
Here are a few example runs of the program:

<p> Sample run 1
<xmp>
Head
Tail
Tail
Head
Head
Tail
Head
Tail
Head
Head
Head
It took 11 flips to get 3 consecutive heads.
</xmp>
<hr>

<p> Sample run 2
<xmp> 
Tail
Head
Tail
Tail
Tail
Tail
Head
Head
Tail
Head
Tail
ead
Head
Tail
Tail
Head
Head
Head
It took 18 flips to get 3 consecutive heads.
</xmp>

<p>
For this lab, you need to submit two files: average.cpp and coin.cpp.
