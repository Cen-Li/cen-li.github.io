      Lab 18 - Stack
      </h1>
      </center>

<p>
In this lab, we will practice coding using the Standard Template Library(STL) container "Stack".
The characteristic of a Stack is : "Last In First Out". 
<p>
The STL stack method include:
<ul>
<li><font color=red>pop</font>: Remove the top element
<li><font color=red>push</font>: Insert the next element
<li><font color=red>top</font>: Access the next element
<li><font color=red>size</font>: Return size
<li><font color=red>empty</font>: Return whether the container is empty
</ul>
Here is a link to the stack class description on cplusplus.com:
<a href=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack/>link to stack</a>.

<p>
Write a program that reads in a list of names from a data file and stores them in a stack.
Afterwards, it prints out the list of names in reverse order.
Then, it prints the names in its original order. 
You are required to use the C++ STL Stack container (not using array or list) for this problem.
You may use more than one stack for the problem.
<p>
Copy the data file using the following command: 
<xmp>
cp ~cen/data/names.dat  workspace-directory/project-directory/.
</xmp>

<p>
This is the expected output of your program:
<xmp>
The list of 13 names in reverse order :
Patrick Eddleman
Joyce Doyle
Susan Demo
Abigail Nash
Vivian Moore
Jill Jones
Roy Fisher
Morgan Freeman
Michael Pitt
Richard Tennant
Mark Zuckerberg
Mick Jagger
Billy Joel


The list of 13 names in the original order :
Billy Joel
Mick Jagger
Mark Zuckerberg
Richard Tennant

</xmp>

For this lab, you need to submit one file: <em>main.cpp</em>.
<p>
<h2>Steps to edit, compile, run, and submit the program:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If after you compile your program, there is compilation errors, then you need to modify the program according to the error messages. 
You may need to edit and compile your program multiple times before it compiles successfully.

<li>Now you can run the program, check to make sure the output is correct. If not, you need to modify the program and recompile and rerun the program.

<li>Once you are able to successfully run the program with the correct outputs, you are ready to submit the program electronically. Only submit the source file. 

Locate the source file in your "project" directory under your "workspace" directory. 
For example, if you named your "workspace" as "codelite" under your home directory, and named the project "cla18", then "main.cpp" should be in ~/codelite/cla18 directory.
