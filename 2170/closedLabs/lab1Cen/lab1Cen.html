  The computer system 
    you will use for CSCI 2170 is a Linux system. Its name is <i>ranger</i>. Ranger runs 
    the Linux operating system, an extremely powerful and popular system. It is 
    not our goal to teach you everything about Linux in this course. However, you 
    will learn enough to do your work in C++ including how to create/edit, print, 
    list, copy, compile, delete, and execute (run) files. Today, you will learn 
    how to log on to <i>ranger</i> and you will customize your account for future labs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><font color="#FF0000"><b>Read 
    the following section completely and then do Exercise 1</b></font><b>.</b></i> 
    To connect to <i>ranger</i> from a PC in the computer lab, double-click the mouse 
    on the<b> <i>CS Linux Gnome</i></b> icon which looks like this: </font> 
  <center>
      <img src="LinuxGnome.jpg" WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=50> 
      
    <p> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(This one is NOT active.) </font>
  </center>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Make sure the icon has the label <b> <i>CS Linux Gnome</i></b></b>. When you double-click 
    on the icon, you should see a new window such as the following open on the desk top.

  <center>
      <img src="NoMachine.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=160> 
  </center>
    In the window displayed and in the Login text box,
    type your <b>class account number</b> provided by your instructor, example c8341803. 
    In the Password text box, enter your password provided by your instructor, example ab2w45.
    You password will echo as a row such as "******".  So be careful in your typing. 
    It will be invisible as you type it. If you make an error, 
    you will be asked to start over by checking the Login account number and re-entering the 
    password information. If your configuration also requests the host, enter <i>ranger.cs.mtsu.edu</i>. 
    After filling in the requested information, click the Login button and after a few seconds, 
    a larger window should appear (as shown below).  If your new window is just a command
    window (<i>white with a prompt</i>, then most likely you selected the wrong icon 
    above, i.e., it was not labeled <b> <i>CS Linux Gnome</i></b>.  
    If you are unsuccessful 
    after several attempts, check to be sure the <b>Caps Lock</b> key is not locked 
    on the keyboard. If it is, unlock it and try again. Otherwise, ask the lab 
    assistant for help. 
    If you are successfully logged on, you will be greeted by the a window such as the following.
    It may take a few seconds for this window to appear and your window may temporarily be dark
    before finally displaying.
    This larger brownish window shows that your PC is properly connected to the <i>ranger</i> system. 
    If you cannot get this larger window to appear, then ask a lab assistant for help.

   Now, there is one more step to the login process. In the larger window there is an icon in the 
   upper left labeled <i> gnome-terminal</i>. Click on this icon.  A new command window should 
   now appear with a system prompt (this will not always be your prompt)</font></p>
    <p align="CENTER"><font face="Courier" size="3" color="006400">

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">which 
    means you can enter UNIX commands. Happy UNIXing!</font></p>

   <p>
   Finally, once you have successfully logged into the <i>ranger</i> system and completed your
   work (as described below), you will need to log out of the system.

Customizing Your Account</font></i></b>
   
  <BR><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Next, 
    you should customize your account. The Computer Science 
    department has created software which will customize your account so that 
    it is easier to use and will allow your teacher to interact with you more 
    easily. The following customization should only be done once.
    You will <b>never</b> have to customize this account again.
     <i><b><font color="#FF0000">Don't type anything until you understand 
    what to do and get to Exercise 2.</font></b> </i>The customization command is as follows:

    &quot;JOHN&quot;.</font></font> 
  <p><font color="#BB2222" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If there are any

  <p><font color="#BB2222" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">then everything

    at it. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#BB2222" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If your customization 
    was OK, you will no longer be using ranger in this closed lab, so log off of ranger by typing

   To log out, locate the top window menu bar 
   with pull down selections for <i>Applications Places System</i> Select the <i>System</i> 
   tab followed by <i>Quit</i> and proceed to logout.  As an alternative, you may use the icon 
   just below the NX window bar window close (the X).
