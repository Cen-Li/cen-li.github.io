Introduction</font></i></b>
  <BR><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In today's lab, 
    we will explore two unrelated topics in the time allowed. We will customize 
    our account on <i>ranger</i> and we will learn how to send and receive electronic

  <BR><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The computer system 
    you will use for CSCI 1170 is a Linux system. Its name is <i>ranger</i>. Ranger runs 
    the Linux operating system, an extremely powerful and popular system. It is 
    not our goal to teach you everything about Linux in this course. However, you 
    will learn enough to do your work in C++ including how to create/edit, print, 
    list, copy, compile, delete, and execute (run) files. Today, you will learn 
    how to log on to <i>ranger</i> and you will customize your account for future labs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><font color="#FF0000"><b>Read 
    the following section completely and then do Exercise 1</b></font><b>.</b></i> 
    To connect to <i>ranger</i> from a PC in the computer lab, double-click the mouse 
    on the<b> <i>CS Linux Gnome</i></b> icon which looks like this: </font> 
  <center>
      <img src="LinuxGnome.jpg" WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=50> 
      
    <p> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(This one is NOT active.) </font>
  </center>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Make sure the icon has the label <b> <i>CS Linux Gnome</i></b></b> When you double-click 
    on the icon, you should see a new window such as the following open on the desk top.

  <center>
      <img src="NoMachine.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=160> 
  </center>
    In the window displayed and in the Login text box,
    type your <b>class account number</b> provided by your instructor, example c8341803. 
    In the Password text box, enter your password provided by your instructor, example ab2w45.
    You password will echo as a row such as "******".  So be careful in your typing. 
    It will be invisible as you type it. If you make an error 
    you will be asked to start over by checking the Login account number and re-entering the 
    password information. If your configuration also requests the host, enter <i>ranger.cs.mtsu.edu</i> 
    After filling in the requested information, click the Login button and after a few seconds, 
    a larger window should appear (as shown below).  If your new window is just a command
    window (<i>white with a prompt</i>, then most likely you selected the wrong icon 
    above, i.e., it was not labeled <b> <i>CS Linux Gnome</i></b>.  
    If you are unsuccessful 
    after several attempts, check to be sure the <b>Caps Lock</b> key is not locked 
    on the keyboard. If it is, unlock it and try again. Otherwise, ask the lab 
    assistant for help. 
    If you are successfully logged on, you will be greeted by the a window such as the following.
    It may take a few seconds for this window to appear and your window may temporarily be dark
    before finally displaying.
    This larger brownish window shows that your PC is properly connected to the <i>ranger</i> system. 
    If you cannot get this larger window to appear, then ask a lab assistant for help.

      <img src="Ubuntu.jpg" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=400> 
    </center> 

    <br>
   <p>
   Now, there is one more step to the login process. In the larger window there is an icon in the 
   upper left labeled <i> gnome-terminal</i>. Click on this icon.  A new command window should 
   now appear with a system prompt (this will not always be your prompt)</font></p>
    <p align="CENTER"><font face="Courier" size="3" color="006400">

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">which 
    means you can enter UNIX commands. Happy UNIXing!</font></p>

   <p>
   Finally, once you have successfully logged into the <i>ranger</i> system and completed your
   work (as described below), you will need to log out of the system. To log out, 
   locate the top window menu bar 
   with pull down selections for <i>Applications Places System</i> Select the <i>System</i> 
   tab followed by <i>Quit</i> and proceed to logout.  As an alternative, you may use the icon 
   just below the NX window bar window close (the X).

    followed by <i>Firefox Web Browser</i>.  Alternatively, the Firefox icon can be found on the window

    After bring up your browser window, arrange the windows for the browser and 
    Command prompt so that one window is not completely over the other. Click the left mouse button 
    on the title bar of the Command window, hold it down and drag the window 
    until at least part of it is outside the browser window. You can make either 
    window active by clicking the mouse on it. Try that now and leave the browser

  over the Internet, we must be able to connect to a computer that has access

  We will send/read mail using <i>MTSU's</i> email server.
  Every registered student at MTSU is issued a student account on MTSU's email server.
This is your permanent student account.
If you have questions about your permanent student account, raise your hand to let the lab instructor know.
(the Information Technology Division (ITD) in Cope 003 (898-5345) needs to be contacted.)
  <B>We will use your permanent student account for email exercieses in this lab.

 Using your MTSU email account, you can send email messages to 
  anyone who has access to the Internet. This means that you can send messages 
  to users at MTSU and to users on other networks. To send email to another user 
  at MTSU, you only need to know the username of the other user. To send email

You should see the window below after clicking on the Forwarding Link.
You will need to do three things in this window.
First, in the <strong>Forward To:</strong> box,
type in the e-mail address that you prefer to use to read your e-mail
(that is, the one you use most often.)
Second, click on the option "Keep a copy of each forwarded message";
you want that box to be checked.
Finally, click on the <strong>Start </strong>button to activate .</font>
