<br>B.&nbsp; <a href="#B">Circular Linked Lists</a>
<br>C.&nbsp; <a href="#C">Dummy head Nodes</a>
<br>D.&nbsp; <a href="#D">Multi-Linked Lists</a></blockquote>

<p>In this lab session we will study some of the more common variations of
linked list structures including lists with more than one pointer field
and the usage of "dummy" nodes in the implementation of linked list structures.&nbsp;
There are many linked list problems which can be&nbsp; "easily" solved
by using one or more of these variations of linked structures.&nbsp; For
example, consider the set of problems in which we must start at the head
and traverse the list until we get one node short of a specified place:
"delete the last node" or "insert before the node pointed to by p."&nbsp;
For many problems, for example,&nbsp; the inefficiency of list traversal
can be removed at the expense of a "backward pointer" or using a doubly
linked list structure rather than a singly linked list.

<!-- PART A ------>
<center><h3>
<a NAME="A"></a>A. Doubly Linked Lists</h3></center>
<p>A linked list in which each node has 2 pointers: a forward pointer (a pointer
to the next node in the list) and a backward pointer (a pointer to the
node preceding the current node in the list) is called a doubly linked
list.&nbsp; Here is a picture:
<center><img SRC="image001.jpg"  alt="image001.jpg"></center>
<p>This list has two special pointers called <b>head1</b> and <b>head2</b> so that the list
may be traversed beginning at either end of the list.

<!--EXERCISE 1 ----->
<hr>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise1')"><b><font color="BB2222">Exercise 1:</font></b></a>
<font color="BB2222">Assume the data

called Node for a node in this list.&nbsp; Use "prev" (for previous)
and "next" as the names of the pointer fields.&nbsp; Call the data
field "data".</font>

<hr>



<p>Before we look at some sample uses, let's learn to manipulate these
doubly linked lists. Imagine we want to insert a new node after (to the
right of) the node pointed to by p. Here is a code segment:
<blockquote>
<blockquote id="box"><b>
<pre>
Node * q;
q = new Node;
q->data = newData;
q->next = p->next;      // make q point where p did to right
q->next->prev = q;      // make node to right of q point back at q
q->prev = p;            // make q point at p on left
p->next = q;            // make p point at q on right
</pre>
</b></blockquote>
</blockquote>
Note that this algorithm will have problems if p points at the last node
in the list.

<hr>


<p>The increased efficiency of certain operations from a doubly linked
list should be obvious as should the increase in space required for the
extra pointers.&nbsp; Is it worth the extra space?&nbsp; That depends.
If you have plenty of space and must have efficient insertion and deletion,
the answer is yes.&nbsp; If you need to move in both directions in
the list, then you have little choice.&nbsp; Take, for example, a doubly
linked list of lines in a document that may be kept by a text editor.&nbsp;
The following denotes how each node should appear:
<br>&nbsp;
<center><img src="image005.jpg" alt="image005.jpg"></center>

<p>To move backward and forward through the document (as it appears on
the screen ) and insert or delete lines, a doubly linked list is ideal.&nbsp; 
With the cursor on the current line (stored in a pointer "current"),it is easy 
to move up one line (current = current->prev) or down one line 
(current = current->next).&nbsp; With a singly linked list this is possible
but probably too slow.

<!--PART B -------->
<center>
<h3>
<a NAME="B"></a>B. Circular Linked Lists</h3></center>
<p>All of our examples so far have required that a linked list have a beginning
node and an ending node: the beginning node was a node pointed to by a
special pointer called <i>head</i> and the end of the list was denoted
by a special node which had a NULL pointer in its <i>next</i> pointer field.&nbsp; 
If a problem requires that operations need to be performed on nodes in
a linked list <b>and</b> it is not important that the list have special
nodes indicating the front and rear of the list, then this problem should
be solved using a <b>circular linked list</b>.&nbsp; A <b>singly
linked circular list</b> is a linked list where the last node in
the list points to the first node in the list.&nbsp; A circular list does
not contain NULL pointers.&nbsp; Note the example of a singly linked circular
list below:
<center><img SRC="image003.jpg" alt="image003.jpg"></center>
<p>A good example of an application where a singly linked circular list
should be used is a timesharing problem solved by the operating system.&nbsp; 
In a timesharing environment, the operating system must maintain a list
of present users and must alternately allow each user to use a small slice
of CPU time, one user at a time.&nbsp; The operating system will pick a
user, let him/her use a small amount of CPU time and then move on to the
next user, etc.&nbsp; For this application, there should be no NULL pointers
unless there is absolutely no one requesting CPU time.

<!--EXERCISE 4 ---->
<hr>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise4')"><b><font color="BB2222">Exercise 4</font></b></a>
<font color="BB2222">Assuming that
it has been determined that we need to manipulate a linked list in such
a fashion that there is no ending node or no beginning node, explain why
you think that a circular linked list should be used.&nbsp; HINT: Will
it eliminate unnecessary processor activities?&nbsp; If so, describe these
activities.</font>
<hr>


<!--PART C -------->
<center>
<h3>
<a NAME="C"></a>C. Dummy head Nodes</h3></center>
<p>One of the problems in dealing with pointer based ordered lists is writing
code to take care of special cases.&nbsp; For example, if we wish to insert
a node in an ordered linked list, we MUST take care of the special case
of inserting this node in the beginning of the list.&nbsp; This is a special
case because if a node is inserted into the beginning of the list, the
pointer indicating the beginning of the list, <b>head</b>,&nbsp; must be
changed.&nbsp; Similarly, if we wish to delete a particular node, we must
again also write code to handle the special case of deleting the first
node in the list.
<p>To avoid the special case problems involved in inserting and deleting
nodes, programmers often use a dummy node in the list.&nbsp; A <b>dummy
header node </b>is a node that always points to the beginning of the list
or has a NULL pointer field if the list is empty.&nbsp; This node is called
a dummy node since it does not contain data included in the list.&nbsp;
This node is permanent (is never deleted) and always points to the first
node in the list.&nbsp; To eliminate the need for special structures, it
is preferred that the dummy node be set up using the same type of nodes
as the data nodes in the list.&nbsp; Here is an example of a singly linked
list with a dummy header node:
<br>&nbsp;

<center>
<img src="image004.jpg" alt="image004.jpg">
</center>

<p>Now, let's determine how to insert a node pointed to by the pointer
<b>p</b> into an ordered singly linked list.&nbsp; If the singly linked
list is ordered, we must first determine where the node should be placed
in the list.&nbsp; This is accomplished by setting up auxillary pointers,
<b>prev</b> and <b>current</b>, moving these pointers down the list until
<b>prev</b> is pointing to a node which should precede the node pointed
to by <b>p</b> and <b>current</b> should be pointing to the first node
which should succeed the node pointed to by <b>p</b>.&nbsp; The question
is: How should <b>prev</b> and <b>current</b> be initialized?&nbsp; If
a singly linked list with a dummy header node is used, then <b>prev</b>
and <b>current</b> should be initialized to <b>head</b> and to <b>head->next</b>
respectively.

<!--EXERCISE 5 ----->
<hr>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise5')"><b><font color="BB2222">Exercise 5:</font></b></a>
<font color="BB2222">Assume that <b>p</b> is pointing to a node that should be inserted at the beginning of the list.  Show code
to insert the node pointed to by the pointer, <i>p</i>, into the beginning
of the list.&nbsp; Don't forget that <i>head</i> is a dummy header and
should never be changed.&nbsp; <!-- You may assume that <i>prev</i> and <i>current</i>
have been set up as stated above.&nbsp; Do not assume the <b>prev</b> and
<b>current</b> are already pointing to the nodes before and after <b>p</b>.  -->

<hr>



<!--PART D -------->
<center>
<h3>
<a NAME="D"></a>D. Multi-Linked lists</h3></center>
<p>A list can have two pointers without having a backward pointer. For instance,
we may want to keep a set of data ordered on more than one "key". A key
is a unique data item included in a record which distinguishes one record
from all other records included in the list.&nbsp; Suppose we want to be
able to access customer accounts in order by account number (integer) and
by customer name (string). We can in fact have one list that
is ordered both ways. We need two pointer fields.&nbsp; Each node of the
list will have the form:
<br>&nbsp;

<center>
<img src="image006.jpg" alt="image006.jpg">
</center>

<p>Now, let's assume that we have a class called <b>MultiListClass</b>
and that we wish to implement this list with a dummy header node.&nbsp;
Here is an example list which implements the multi-linked list:
<center><img SRC="image007.jpg" alt="image007.jpg"></center>
Insertion and deletion require about twice the work since two sets of pointers
must be adjusted: one for the name and one for the account number.&nbsp;
Essentially, you perform the same adjustments as in a singly linked list
but you do it twice.

<!--EXERCISE 6 ----->

<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise6')"><b><font color="BB2222">Exercise 6:</font></b></a>
<font color="BB2222">Redraw the picture
after: Able, 99200 is inserted.</font>
<hr>


<p>Insertion and deletion are more complicated in multi-linked lists.&nbsp;
Below is a function we have written which inserts the new node into the
linked list which is ordered alphabetically by the customer name.&nbsp;
We use the notation from above.
<blockquote><blockquote id="box">
<b>
<pre>
// Algorithm for insertion into multi-linked list with two links.
//This is the structure of nodes in the list
struct Node
{
     TypeData name;       //Person's name
     TypeInt number;      //Person's account number
     TypePtr nextNum;     //Pointer to next record by account number
     TypePtr nextName;    //Pointer to next record by name
};

//Function to insert a node into a linked list ordered by customer name
void MultiListClass::insertNameList (TypePtr p)
//IN:&nbsp; p points to the node to be inserted into the list
{
     //initialize prev and current
     TypePtr prev = head;
     TypePtr current = head->nextName;

     //move prev and current until current is NULL or 
     //current is pointing to a node which contains a name 
     //that is larger than the name to be inserted into the list
     while (!insertName (current,p))
     {
           prev = current;
           current = current->nextName;
     }

     //insert the node between prev and current
     prev ->nextName = p;
     p->nextName = current;
}
</pre></b></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Now, we also need a function which will insert the node into the list ordered
by the customer account number:
<blockquote><blockquote id="box">
<b>
<pre>
//Function to insert a node into a linked list ordered by customer 
//account number
void MultiListClass::insertNumList (TypePtr p)
{
     //Initialize prev and current
     TypePtr prev = head;
     TypePtr current = head->nextNum;

     //Move prev and current until current is NULL or is pointing 
     //to a node which contains a customer number that is larger 
     //than the customer number contained in the node to be inserted
     while (!insertNum (current, p))
     {
          prev = current;
          current = current->nextNum;
     }

     //Insert the node between prev and current
     prev ->nextNum = p;
     p->nextNum = current;
}
</pre></b></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>We have implemented this insert algorithm in <a href="javascript:Display('$CLA/inlab10.cc')">inlab10.cc</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
