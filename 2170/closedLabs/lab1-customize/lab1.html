<B>BACKGROUND:</B>
The computer system you will use in CSCI 2170 for programming
this summer is named <B><i>ranger2</i></B>.
Be sure you're always using <B><i>ranger2</i> and not one of the
other <i>ranger</i> machines, such as <i>ranger0</i> or <i>ranger1</i>.
Somewhat confusingly perhaps, as we'll always be using just
<B><i>ranger2</i></B>, we'll often just say <i>ranger</i>.)
&nbsp;
<I>Ranger</I> runs the UNIX operating system,
an extremely powerful and popular system.
There are different "dialects" of UNIX,
such as <I>Mac OS X</I> or <I>HP-UX</I>.
The UNIX dialect running on ranger is called <B><I>Linux</I></B>.

<P>
Unlike a small personal computer that you physically handle to use,
<I>ranger</I> is a server that we will use via a network connection.
In CSCI 2170 each user is given an account, uniquely identified by
a <I>C-number</I>, that will be used when connecting to <I>ranger</I>.
Your work will be done while logged in to that course account.
Because your files are stored under your
course account on <I>ranger</I>, it doesn't matter where you are or
what computer you're using to connect to <I>ranger</I>, your files
will always be available to you.
In this lab,
you will do a one-time customization of your course computer account
to get it ready for the rest of the semester.

DIRECTIONS:  Follow the instructions and
perform the actions indicated as they appear in the text.
</FONT>
<!--
(This is <I>different</I> from standard closed labs where you only do
something when it is inside an exercise.)
-->
<BR>
To do this lab, you will first need to have been given your
<I>C-number</I> (and corresponding <I>password</I>)
by your course instructor.

<P>
<BR>
<B>Step 1: LOG IN USING <FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="blue">PuTTy</FONT></B>
<BR>
To connect to the <I>ranger2</I> server from the personal computer
you are sitting at, you will need to use a program known as a
<B>terminal client</B>.
For lab 1, we will use a terminal client found on the CS lab machines
called <FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="blue">PuTTy</FONT></B>.
<BR>
Locate the <FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="blue">CSCI1170 PuTTy</FONT>
icon on the desktop as shown:
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="CSCI1170-PuTTy.png" ALT="PuTTy icon" WIDTH="20%">
</CENTER>
Being sure you have the correct PuTTy icon (there are several),
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-click">double-click</A>
the icon to activate the PuTTy terminal client program.
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="green">
NOTE:
If you get a "WARNING - POTENTIAL SECURITY BREACH" message, ignore it
and hit "Yes" to continue.
</FONT>

<P>
You will then see a login window like the following
(except the color scheme may be different--for example, you may have
a dark background):
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="PuTTyLogin.png" ALT="PuTTy icon" WIDTH="50%">
</CENTER>


<P>
Use your <I>course account</I> information to access <I>ranger</I>.  
At the <FONT SIZE="+1"><tt>login as:</tt></FONT> prompt,
enter your course account's <I>C-number</I>
(that is, the 8&nbsp;character login <I>username</I> you were assigned;
for example, c1003639). 
When prompted for a <FONT SIZE="+1"><tt>Password:</tt></FONT>,
enter your course account's <I>password</I>; for example 74aB2w45.
Your password will not be displayed
so be careful in your typing; 
hit the enter key when you are done typing the password.
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="green">
NOTE:
UNIX is <I>case-sensitive</I>,
that is, it distinguishes between upper and lower case letters.
It is important to type the information exactly as indicated.
</FONT>

<P>
<I>
<B>If you entered something wrong,</B> you will get an error message:
</I>
<BR><TT>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Access denied
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Using keyboard-interactive authentication.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Password:
</TT>
<BR>
<I>
If you typed the password wrong, you will be able to re-enter
the password information.
However if you entered the username (<I>C-number</I>) incorrectly
you must start over by closing the window
(click on the title bar's <B>Close</B> <IMG SRC="close4.gif">
button on the top right corner of the window)
and bring up a new <FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="blue">CSCI1170 PuTTy</FONT> window.
If you are unsuccessful after several attempts,
check to be sure the <b>Caps Lock</b> key is not locked 
on the keyboard. If it is, unlock it and try again.
Otherwise, ask the lab assistant for help.
</I>

<P>
Once you successfully login to the server, you will see something like:

<B>Step 2: CUSTOMIZE YOUR ACCOUNT:</B>
<BR>
Much of UNIX is "command&nbsp;driven"; that's a fancy way of saying
that to get most things done, you type out command instructions 
inside a <I>Terminal</I> window instead of clicking on icons.
(Another term for this is that you're using a <B>CLI</B> or
<B>C</B>ommand <B>L</B>ine <B>I</B>nterface.)
Recall that UNIX is <I>case-sensitive</I> and thus
distinguishes between upper and lower case letters.
It is important to type the commands exactly as indicated.
Failing to put in a space where required is an error; however
when a space is required, the amount of space (i.e., the number of blanks)
is usually not critical.

The Computer Science department has created software that will
customize your account so that it is suitable to use for this course.
The following customization should only be done once.
You will <b>never</b> need to customize this account again.

<P>
The general form of the customization command is as follows:
<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT>&nbsp;
<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue>~cs/customize 2170  cen
</FONT>
</FONT>
</CENTER>
<BR>
With your mouse, 
click on the arrow next to "Select teacher's userid." and highlight 
the appropriate userid (your lab instructor will tell you which one).
The command above should now have your teacher's userid on the end of the line.

<OL>
<LI>
In the <I>PuTTy Terminal</I> window, at the <FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT> prompt,
enter the customize line exactly as shown above.
(Do NOT enter the dollar sign as part of your
command. It is meant to represent the prompt provided by the system.) 


<P>
<LI>
   The customization will ask you for your first (personal/nickname)
   name and last (family) name.  Use mixed-case in entering your names;
   for example, enter "John" and not "john" or "JOHN".  Next you will
   be asked for your PipelineMT user name.  (You will NOT be asked
   for your PipelineMT password.)  Lastly you must enter the 3-digit
   course section number.

<P>
<LI>
   If there are any errors, please review what you have done and
   start over at step 1.
   Otherwise, close the terminal window by typing
   <FONT COLOR="blue" SIZE="+1"><TT>exit</TT></FONT>.

<P>
<LI>
   Now open up a <I>PuTTy Terminal</I> window again.
   It should be similar to:
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="PuTTyConfirmation.png" ALT="PuTTy confirmation" WIDTH="50%">
</CENTER>
   with CSCI 2170 Notices appearing (highlighted by top red arrow)
   and a prompt now of the form "ranger2$"
   If your screen has these items, everything is OK.
   If not, please check with the instructor as to what might have gone wrong.

<p>
<LI> Next type "handin" at the ranger$
  prompt.  Enter your course account password (see above) when
  requested.  Finally, enter "exit" to close the terminal window.


<P>
<LI>
<B>LOG OFF:</B>
Once you are done, you will need to log off <I>ranger</I>
by entering
<FONT COLOR="blue" SIZE="+1"><TT>exit</TT></FONT>
at the command-line.

</OL>
