<h2>Introduction</h2>
In today's lab, 
    we will learn how to log on to our account on <i>ranger</i> using two terminal software, PuTTy and NX,
    and we will do a one-time customization of the account to make it easier to work with.</p>

<h2>
Customizing Your Account with PuTTy 
</h2>

The computer system you will use for CSCI 2170 is named <i>ranger</i>. 
(Actually, ranger is an umbrella name for several actual machines, such as ranger1 or ranger2.
Because it doesn't matter which particular ranger machine you are using, we'll just say ranger.) 
	  Ranger runs the UNIX operating system, an extremely powerful and popular system.
(There are different "dialects" of UNIX,
such as <i>Mac OS X</i> or <i>HP-UX</i>.
The UNIX dialect running on ranger is called <b><i>Linux</i></b>.)
<p>
Unlike a small personal computer that you physically handle to use, ranger is a server that 
we will use via a network connection. This lab will demonstrate two methods of connecting to ranger; 
PuTTy and NX Ranger Desktop which uses remote X Window System connections.
PyTTy provides a text-based terminal not X-based.
</p>
<p>
As part of this lab, you will also do a one-time customization of your course computer account
for future labs.

<p>
DIRECTIONS: Follow the instructions and perform the actions indicated as they appear in the text. 
To do this lab, you will first need to have been given your C-number (and corresponding password) by your course instructor.
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Log on to ranger using PuTTy</h3>
To connect to <b>ranger</b> from anywhere, you need to use a terminal software.  We will use PuTTy for this step.  Locate the <b>PuTTy (ranger)</b> icon in the desktop as shown in the following figure.

<center>
<img src="putty.png" height="500" width="650">
</center>
<br />
You should double click  on the PuTTy(ranger) icon.
You will then see a login screen such as the following. 

<center>
<img src="login.png" width="500">
</center>
<br />
Your instructor has given you a course account, that is, a pair of codes
(<i>username</i> and <i>password</i>) that you will use to access <i>ranger</i>.  
Enter your course account's 8 character login <i>username</i>; for example, c1055913. 
When it prompt for "Password:", 
enter your course account's <i>password</i>; for example aB2W45.
You won't see anything while you type your password.  Just hit the enter key when you are done typing.

<b>Note: </b> UNIX is <I>case-sensitive</I>,
that is, it distinguishes between upper and lower case letters.
It is important to type the information exactly as indicated.
If you make any typing error, you will get an error message as following: 
<pre>Access denied
Using keyboard-interactive authentication.
Password:</pre>
If you made typing error on password, you can re-enter the <tt>Password</tt> information. 
However, if you have entered an incorrect username, you must close the window by clicking
on the closed button (the red X button on the right top corner of the window),
and restart the PuTTy(ranger) window.

Once you successfully log on to the server, you may get a screen as below:

</center>
<br />

<h3>Step 2: Customize your account</h3>
Much of UNIX is "command&nbsp;driven"; that's a fancy way of saying
that to get most things done, you type out command instructions 
inside a <I>Terminal</I> window instead of clicking on icons.
UNIX is <I>case-sensitive</I>,
that is, it distinguishes between upper and lower case letters.
It is important to type the commands exactly as indicated.
Failing to put in a space where required is an error; however
when a space is required, the amount of space (i.e., the number of blanks)
is usually not critical.

The Computer Science department has created software that will
customize your account so that it is suitable to use for this course.
The following customization should only be done once.
You will <b>never</b> need to customize this account again.

<P>
The customization command is as follows:
<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT>&nbsp;
<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue>~cs/customize 2170  cen
</FONT>
</FONT>
</CENTER>
<BR>

<OL>
<LI>
In the <I>PuTTy Terminal</I> window, at the <b>$</b> prompt,
enter the customize line exactly as show above.
(Do NOT enter the dollar sign as part of your
command. It is meant to represent the prompt provided by the system.) 
</li>

<P>
<LI>
   The customization will ask you for your first (personal/nickname)
   name and last (family) name.  Use mixed-case in entering your names;
   for example, enter "John" and not "john" or "JOHN".  Next you will
   be asked for your PipelineMT user name.  (You will NOT be asked
   for your PipelineMT password.)  Lastly you must enter the 3-digit
   course section number.
</li>

<P>
<LI>
   If there are any errors, please review what you have done and
   start over at step 1.
   Otherwise, close the terminal window by typing "exit".
</li>

<P>
<LI>
   Now open up a <I>PuTTy Terminal</I> window again.
   If your prompt now is of the form "<font color="green">ranger<font color="red">$</font></font>",
   everything is OK.  If not, please check with the instructor as
   to what might have gone wrong.
   You should see a window similar to the following figure.
</li>
<center>
<img src="putty3.png" width="500">
</center>
<br />

<li>Once you are done, you will need to log off <I>ranger</I> by typing "exit".
</li>
</OL>

<h2>Logging On to the Server using NX Ranger</h2>
We used PuTTy to customize our account.  From now on, we will be using a different terminal software, 
called NX Ranger Desktop, to access ranger. NX Ranger Desktop uses remote X Window System connections.
Find the NX Ranger Desktop icon as shown in the figure below.

<center>
<img src="login2.png" height="500" width="650">
</center>
<br />
Double click on the NX Ranger Desktop icon. You should get an NX login window.

<center>
      <img src="login3.png"> 
</center>

<br />
After filling in the requested information, click the Login button and after a few seconds, 
a full-screen window should appear (as depicted below). We call this the UNIX Desktop window. 
(You may have to click "OK" few times to get the Desktop window.)
<p><i> 
Note: If you are unsuccessful after several attempts, check to be sure the <b>Caps Lock</b> key is not locked 
on the keyboard. If it is, unlock it and try again.  Otherwise, ask the lab assistant for help.
It may take a few seconds for the UNIX Desktop to appear and your window may temporarily be dark
before finally fully displaying.
If you cannot get the UNIX Desktop window to appear, then ask a lab assistant for help.

<h3>GETTING A TERMINAL WINDOW:</h3>
Once you have an active <I>UNIX&nbsp;Desktop</I>, you will open up a <I>Terminal</I> window.

<P>
There are several ways to open up a <I>Terminal</I> window.
The suggested methods for this lab are to look at the left-hand portion of the top menu bar
and single-click on the <B>Terminal</B> icon or double click on the terminal icon in the desktop
as shown in the figure.
<BR>
    <center>
      <img src="XfceTerminalIcon.png" width="600"> 
    </center> 

<P>
(Alternatively, if the Terminal icon is missing, you can move your mouse to
the top menu bar where the pull down selections
for <tt><u>Applications</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Places</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>System</u>&nbsp;</tt>
are located (top left) and select the <u><tt>Applications</tt></u> tab
and then select the <u><tt>System</tt></u> item
and then finally select the <u><tt>Terminal</tt></u> item.)

<P>
You should now have a <I>Terminal</I> window
on your UNIX&nbsp;Desktop.  (See picture below.)
You can move windows and arrange them as you like.
To move a window, click the left mouse button on the title bar of the window,
hold it down and drag the window into position.
To make a window active, click the mouse on that window.

    </center> 

<h3>LOG OFF:</h3>
Once you are done, you will need to log off <I>ranger</I>
and close your <B><i>UNIX&nbsp;Desktop</i></B>.
To log out, click the green (running person) <i>Quit</i> icon on the far right of the menu bar. 
<P>
    <center>
      <img src="XfceQuit.png"> 
    </center> 
<BR>
In the resulting window, select the <I>Log Out</I> item.
<P>
    <center>
      <img src="logout.png"> 
    </center> 
<BR>
<P>
(As an alternate way to log out,
move your mouse to the top menu bar where the pull down selections
for <tt>&nbsp;<u>Applications</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Places</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>System</u>&nbsp;</tt>
are located.  [Top left of the bar.]
Select the <u><tt>System</tt></u> tab
and then select the <u><tt>Quit</tt></u> option and proceed to log out.)
