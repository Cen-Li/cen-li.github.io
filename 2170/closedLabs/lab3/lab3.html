Lab 3 -- Programming C++ using Conditional Statements
      </h1>
      </center>
<p>
In this lab, you will write two C++ programs using decision statements. <br>

<p>
<font color=blue><h2>Programming Problem One</h2></font>
Write a C++ program named <font color=red>"student.cpp"</font>. 
This program prompts the user to enter the number of credit hours earned sofar and 
displays his/her corresponding category:
<ul>
<li> Freshman: students with <= 15 credit hours earned
<li> Sophomore: 15 < credit hours earned <= 45
<li> Junior: 45 < credit hours earned <= 75
<li> Senior: 75 < credit hours earned 
</ul>
If the user input is not valid, i.e., credit hours entered < 0, an error message should be displayed.
<p>
<font color=red>You are required to use the multi-way decision statement, i.e., the if-else if-else, 
statement for this problem. </font>
<p>
Here are a few example runs of the program:

<p> Sample run 1
<xmp>
Please enter your total credit hours earned: 30
You are a Sophomore.
</xmp>
<hr>

<p> Sample run 2
<xmp>
Please enter your total credit hours earned: 82
You are a Senior.
</xmp>
<hr>

<p> Sample run 3
<xmp>
Please enter your total credit hours earned: 12
You are a Freshman.
</xmp>

<p> Sample run 4
<xmp>
Please enter your total credit hours earned: -10
Invalid input.
</xmp>
<hr>

For this part of the lab, you need to submit the program:<b>student.cpp</b>.
<p>

<font color=blue><h2>Programming Problem Two</h2></font>

Write a C++ program, named <font color=red>"inorder.cpp"</font>, that reads three integer values from the
user (through keyboard entry), then display the three values in ascending order. For
example, if the user entered 3 values: 84 3 130, the program should output the three
values as: 3, 84, 130.
Here are a few example runs of the program:

<p> Sample run 1
<xmp>
Please enter three integer values: 4 10 6
The three values in ascending order are: 4 6 10
</xmp>
<hr>

<p> Sample run 2
<xmp>
Please enter three integer values: 20 5  3
The three values in ascending order are: 3 5 20
</xmp>
<hr>

<p> Sample run 3
<xmp>
Please enter three integer values: 5 10 20 
The three values in ascending order are: 5 10 20
</xmp>
<hr>

<p> Sample run 4
<xmp>
Please enter three integer values: 20  6  10
The three values in ascending order are: 6 10 20
</xmp>
<hr>

<p>

For this part of the lab, you need to submit the program:<b>inorder.cpp</b>. 

<h2>What to submit for this lab? </h2>
<p>Submit the following files:  <b>student.cpp </b> and <b>inorder.cpp</b>.
