  Directory
  Structure: Main Directory: manual
             Contents: 

             --- index.html --- an index page that provides links to all the 
             individual lesson pages. This Page also checks the browser for
             Javascript support. A <noscript> tag is used to produce a message
             warning the user of limited access. Javascript will also warn the 
             user if they are accessing the site with a sub level 4 browser. 
             --- mainbg.gif --- a background for index.html
             --- windows.js --- a Javascript source code file required by each
             lesson page. Needed to produce separate browser windows.
             --- styles.css --- an external Cascading Style Sheet file required
             by each lesson page & answer sheet.
             --- SiteDesign --- this document, an overview of this site.

         --- subdirectories ---

             --- counter --- contains all the necessary files needed to record
                             and view visitor stats for this site: number of 
                             hits, browser type, etc. ( see counter/notes.txt
                             for the details on recording and viewing this
                             information )
             --- each Lab--- all materials related to the individual lab
                             ( lesson, answer sheet, etc. ) will be contained in
                             it's directory. 
                             [ a more complete list is included below ]
                                

             CGI Directory & Files:

             --- http://www.mtsu.edu/cgi-bin/users/csdept/217man

             --- master.pl --- a copy of the CSCI 117 Perl script modified for
             the 217 directory.

             --- AnswerSheet.pl --- the above file modified to support the 
             separate answer sheet window.

             ---viewcode.pl --- a Perl Script to retrieve C++ Source Code Files
             ( stored in the $CLA directory for student use ) and display these
             files in the browser ( html format ).

             --- counter.pl --- a Perl Script to track page counts and record a
             visitor log.

             --- viewlog.pl --- a Perl Script to report visitor stats in HTML format.
             This script is accessed at 
                   http://www.mtsu.edu/~csci217/counter/index.html

  Lesson 
  Files: --- lab#.html (# = 1, 2, 3... etc.) --- main lesson text   
         --- lab#Ans.html --- an answer sheet used by the student to record and
         print lesson assignments for grading.
         --- lab#.gif --- a background graphic, all backgrounds used in 217 
         were taken from the 117 online manual pages.
         --- *.gif --- additional graphics as needed - file names are coded 
         as follows: when more than one is used: labXSectionNumber.gif
         labX is the actual lab number, Section is A, B, etc., Number is the 
         place (first(1), second(2), etc) in that section if more than one 
         is needed. {Example: lab6A1.gif - 1st image in lab 6 section A}
         When a special graphic is need only for the answer sheet it will
         contain 'Ans' in the name.
         --- other files as needed 

  Lesson
  Layout: The main page contains all the course text copied from the CSCI 217
          Lab Manual mentioned above. The answer sheet and other reference
          material used by the lab is designed to open in separate smaller
          browser window. The answer window provides the student with the option
          to save their answers for later use or to produce a final version 
          suitable for printing. 

  Requirements:
     A 4.0+ Browser with Javascript "ON" for a fully functional session. The
     MTSU default browser ( Netscape ) is recommended due to the following:
     under certain conditions Microsoft Internet Explorer will loose the ability
     to run the Javascripts if one of the child windows is closed. Refreshing
     the page will usually correct this situation.
     
     Each lesson page must load the script file by placing a link in the header
     telling the browser where the file is located:

                  <SCRIPT SRC="../windows.js">
                  document.write("Included JS file not found");
                  </SCRIPT>

     The functions must be called using standard Javascript link procedure:

       <a href="javascript:AnswerWindow('lab1/lab1')">Create Answer Sheet</a>

     other resource material:
       <a href="javascript:Display('$CLA/inlab1.cc')">inlab1.cc source code</a>

     or pages:
       <a href="javascript:Display('http://www.mtsu.edu')"> MTSU Site </a>
       <a href="javascript:Display('../lab2/lab2.html')"> Lab 2 </a>

     The scripts could be placed on each page if level 3.0 browser support was 
     required but due to the size of this site I opted to make the code more
     generic and easier to change should the need arise.

     The production of the Answer sheet requires the Perl CGI file masterAns.pl
     The location of this file ( at this time ) is listed above. If this 
     location changes it will necessary to modify the directory variable in the 
     windows.js file. The masterAns.pl file also contains and uses this 
     location so it will also need to be modified.

     Colors, fonts, and basic design items are stored in one file, styles.css
     a link to this file is included in the head of lesson & answer pages:

   <LINK rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../styles.css" title="styles">

     Omitting this link will simply result in the browser default settings
     being used to display the page. Changes made here are universal to all
     pages loading this style sheet. 

     Visitor Counts and Logs are recorded by Counter.pl in the cgi-bin listed 
     above. To call this script an image tag should be placed in the calling
     page passing the action 'count' and the page 'name' separated by an 
     underline '_' to the script file:
     <img src="http://www.mtsu.edu/cgi-bin/users/csdept/217man/counter.pl?count_lab1">

End of File.
