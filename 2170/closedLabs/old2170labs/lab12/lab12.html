<h3>
<a NAME="A"></a>A.&nbsp; Abstract Data Type </h3></center>
<p>In previous labs, we have used the phrase Abstract Data Type to describe some 
of our classes.&nbsp; In particular, we used it to describe the <em><strong>list</strong></em> 
class.&nbsp; In this section, we explore exactly what we mean by Abstract Data Type (ADT).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In Lab 5, we looked at common primitive data types like int, double, char and 
so on.&nbsp; We say a data type is characterized by:</p>
<ol>
	<li>a set of values,</li>
	<li>a data representation common to all these values, and</li>
	<li>a set of operations which can be applied uniformly to all of these 
	values. </li>
</ol>
<p>For example, an <strong>int</strong> data type contains the set of negative 
and positive whole numbers plus 0.&nbsp; The data representation is a string of 
binary digits and the operations include +, -, *, /, and so on.</p>
<p>An ADT is similar to a data type though slightly different.&nbsp; It is a set of 
values and a set of operations that can be applied uniformly to these values.&nbsp; 
When we use the word abstract, we usually generalize or leave out information.&nbsp;
</p>

<!-- EXERCISE 1 -->
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise1')"><b><font color="BB2222">Exercise 1:</font></b></a><font color="BB2222">Compare 
the description of a data type and an abstract data type. What information was 
left out?</font></p>
<hr>
<p class="newStyle1">A <strong>class</strong> defines a data type.&nbsp; The <strong>instances</strong> 
of a class (or objects of the class) are the possible values of the class.&nbsp; The 
operations on the objects are the <strong>methods</strong> defined in the 
class.&nbsp; The data representation is all the data members that are contained 
within the object.&nbsp; If there is no external access to the data representation, 
the class is an abstract data type.&nbsp; The underlying representation of the data 
members is not important as long as the operations work properly.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example, suppose we have a Calendar class.&nbsp; It is an ADT because the 
underlying data representation of a calendar is unimportant.&nbsp; All the user of 
the calendar cares about are the operations that can be done such as display the 
calendar, change the month to the next month or previous month, change the year, 
or select a given day on the calendar.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we will learn about a stack which is a very 
important abstract data type.</p>

<!-- PART B -->
<center>
<h3>
<a NAME="B"></a>B.&nbsp; Stacks</h3></center>
<p>A <b>stack</b> is an abstract data type that contains a set of values and permits insertion and deletion
at only one end called the <b>top</b>.&nbsp; Note:
<ol>
<li>
Description of elements:&nbsp; A stack is defined to hold one type of data
element.&nbsp; Only the element indicated by the <i>top</i> can be accessed.&nbsp;
The elements are related to each other by the order in which they are put
on the stack.</li>

<li>
Description of operations:&nbsp; Among the standard operations for a stack
are:
<br>
<br>(a)&nbsp; insert an element on top of the stack (push),
<br>(b)&nbsp; remove the top element from the stack (pop),
<br>(c) determine if the stack is empty.</li>
</ol>

<p>An example of a stack is the pop-up mechanism that holds trays or plates
in a cafeteria.&nbsp; The last plate placed on the stack (insertion) is
the first plate off the stack (deletion).&nbsp; A stack is sometimes called
a <b>Last-In, First-Out</b> or <b>LIFO</b> data structure.&nbsp; Stacks
have many uses in computing.&nbsp; They are used in&nbsp; solving such
diverse problems as "evaluating an expression" to "traversing a maze."
<p>A stack data structure is used when subprograms are called.&nbsp; The
system must remember where to return after the called subprogram has executed.&nbsp;
It must remember the contents of all local variables before control was
transferred to the called subprogram.&nbsp; The return from a subprogram
is to the instruction following the call that originally transferred control
to the subprogram.&nbsp; Therefore, the return address and the local variables
of the calling subprogram must be stored in a designated area in memory.&nbsp;
For example, suppose function A has control and calls B which calls C which
calls D.&nbsp; While D is executing, the return stack might look like this:
<center><img src="image006.jpg"></center>
<p>The first "return" would return (from D) to the return address in Function
C and the return stack would then look like:
<center><img src="image007.jpg"></center>

<p>The last function called is the first one completed.&nbsp; Function C cannot
finish execution until Function D has finished execution.&nbsp; The sequence
in which these functions are executed is last-in, first-out.&nbsp; Therefore,
a stack is the logical data structure to use for storing return addresses
and local variables during subprogram invocations.&nbsp; You can see that
the "stack" keeps the return addresses in the exact order necessary to
reverse the steps of the forward chain of control as A calls B, B calls C, C
calls D.
<p>Suppose we want to print a linked list in reverse order.&nbsp; A stack
is the storage structure we need to hold the data in the nodes of the list
as we traverse the list in a forward fashion.&nbsp; We traverse the linked
list starting at the head.&nbsp; As each node is visited its data value
is pushed onto a stack.&nbsp; Once the stack is built, we will take each
item off the stack one at a time and print it giving the last to first
order desired.
<br>&nbsp;
<center>
<img src="image001.gif">
</center>

<p>For example, traversing the list and "pushing" each element onto a stack
would give the following stack:
<br>&nbsp;
<center>
<img src="image002.gif">
</center>

<p>Removing one element at a time from the stack and printing we have the
following:
<blockquote>
<blockquote><b><pre>75.44, &nbsp; 56.25, &nbsp; 92.75, &nbsp;35.60</pre></b></blockquote>

<!-- EXERCISE 2 -->
<hr>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise2')"><b><font color="BB2222">Exercise 2:</font></b></a><font color="BB2222">It is now time
to review what we know about stacks.&nbsp; Answer the following:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which stack element(s) can
be accessed?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Name three operations which
can be performed on a stack.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A stack is called a LIFO
structure.&nbsp; What does this mean?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D.&nbsp;&nbsp; Give an example of an application
of the stack.</font><hr>

<!-- Blank Space -->
<br>&nbsp;

<p>The stack data structure is one example of a restricted list.&nbsp;
It is restricted because insertion and deletion can only occur at the <i>top</i>
of the stack.&nbsp; A stack is the simplest type of list.
<p>We will use a class called <b>Stack</b> to represent the stack abstract
data type. <b>Insertion</b> and <b>deletion</b> operations have special
names in stacks--insertion is called "<b>push</b>" and deletion is called
"<b>pop</b>".&nbsp; Thus <i>s.push(item)</i> means to insert "item" at
the top of stack s and&nbsp; <i>s.pop()</i> means to remove the value at
the top of the stack.

<!-- PART C -->
<center>
<h3>
<a NAME="C"></a>C.&nbsp; Array Implementation of&nbsp; the Stack Class</h3></center>
<p>A stack's data can be represented internally in various ways. We will illustrate
two methods and discuss the merits of each.&nbsp; First, we demonstrate
how it can be represented using an <b>array</b>.
<p>The data in a stack could be implemented using a data member which
is an array called <b>elements[0..MAX_STACK_SIZE-1]</b>.&nbsp; The stack of elements
could be built up (from low index, 0, toward higher indices) or down (from high
index, MAX_STACK_SIZE-1, toward lower indices).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is just a matter of taste.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We also need a data member that indicates the location of the top of the
stack.&nbsp; Call it <b>top</b>.&nbsp; When the stack is empty we have the following&nbsp;
(the ?? means the memory locations are uninitialized) :
<p>&nbsp;

<img src="image003.gif">
<p>Note that <b>s.top</b> contains the value -1, meaning that the stack is empty.
<p>If we push one item, say 92, on the stack we have:
<p><img src="image004.gif">
<p>Note that <b>s.top</b> now contains the value 0 meaning that the top of the stack is <b>
s.element[0]</b>.<p>

<!-- EXERCISE 3 -->
<hr>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise3')"><b><font color="BB2222">Exercise 3:</font></b></a><font color="BB2222">Show the array
s.elements[] and s.top from above&nbsp; after the following operations have all been
completed: (Draw the final picture of s.elements[] and show the value of
s.top)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. s.push(20)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. s.push(51)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. s.pop()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. s.push(43)</font><hr>

<br>&nbsp;

<p>An array has some fixed limit like <b>MAX_STACK_SIZE</b> above.&nbsp; If top is MAX_STACK_SIZE-1, the
stack is full and an error should occur if you try to <i>push</i> another
item onto the stack.&nbsp;&nbsp; If an array implementation were used,
a member function <b>full()</b> should be included which will perform a
test for a full stack.&nbsp; Likewise, a member function <b>empty()</b>
should be included which will be used to determine if a <i>pop</i> were
valid.&nbsp; A <i>pop</i> from an empty stack (top is -1) should cause
an error condition.&nbsp; Both error conditions must be handled.
<p>We have implemented a stack class using an array.&nbsp; The file <a href="javascript:Display('$CLA/inlab12a.h')">inlab12a.h</a>
includes the declaration of the class and the implementation of the class
is included in the file <a href="javascript:Display('$CLA/inlab12a.cc')">inlab12a.cc</a>.

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p>This implementation of a stack has a few disadvantages.&nbsp; Since
we are using an array, we must know in advance the upper bound for the
number of elements in the list.&nbsp; In some situations, knowledge of
such an upper bound is impossible.&nbsp; If we use an upper bound which
is extremely large (in order to have a stack which can contain our data),
we may be wasting space if our data turns out to be quite small.&nbsp;
If we select an upper bound too small, then we have to worry about a stack
overflow.&nbsp; Thus&nbsp; we may find it advantageous to use a dynamic
linked list implementation instead of the static array implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In a linked list implementation, space is allocated only as needed.&nbsp;
If we do have a reasonable upper bound for the number of elements, the
static implementation of the stack has the advantage of using less space
per element than a dynamic list since a dynamic linked list must contain
nodes with a data&nbsp; field <b>and</b> a link field.

<!-- PART D -->
<center>
<h3>
<a NAME="D"></a>D.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pointer Implementation of Stacks</h3></center>
<p>The problem with a "full" stack almost disappears if we use a linked list
implementation of a stack.&nbsp; With a list, the "full" condition will
only be <b>true</b> if there is no more memory for the system to allocate
to your program.&nbsp;&nbsp; While this can happen (and does), it is much
less frequent than filling up an array.

<font color="BB2222">We are going
to modify the program main12.cc&nbsp; to read a string and determine if
the string is a palindrome.&nbsp; A palindrome is a string which is the
same whether the characters are read from left to right or from right to
left.&nbsp; For example "radar" , "deed", and "able was I ere I saw elba"
are all examples of palindromes.&nbsp; There is a simple algorithm to determine
whether a string is a palindrome:</font>

<blockquote>
<blockquote id="box"><b>
<pre><font color="BB2222">
push each letter of the string on a stack.&nbsp; Also place the character
into a character array, say str.
Set j = 0 and done = false
While the stack is not empty and not(done)
     pop a character, say ch
     if str[j] == ch then 
        increment j and continue
     else set done to true (the string isn't a palindrome)
if done is true
   the string isn't a palindrome
else it is.</font></pre></b>

<font color="BB2222">The first part of <i>main12.cc</i> needs to be modified slightly.&nbsp;

needs to be saved in a character array.&nbsp; Modify the&nbsp; program
to correspond with the algorithm above.&nbsp; Turn in a listing, compile
and run of this modified program.&nbsp; Test your program with the strings
listed above and with a string which is not a palindrome to demonstrate
that it works.</font><hr>
