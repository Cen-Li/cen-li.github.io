<a NAME="A"></a>A. Efficiency of Algorithms</h3></center>
One goal of software engineering is to design efficient algorithms.
At it's heart, the concept of efficiency is NOT about expending very little
effort or using very few resources.  Instead, efficiency is about ensuring that
all actions/resources associated with an algrithm are usefully employed.
That is, an algorithm is efficient if it can solve a problem
without wasting effort or resources.
<p>Consider the following very inefficient search algorithm to locate an element <b>s</b> in an
array <b>a[0..n-1]</b>.
<blockquote>
<blockquote id="box">
<pre>
<b>found = false
k = 0
while not found and k &lt; n - 1
{
       k = k + 1
       for (i = 0; i &lt; k; i++)
           if (a[i] == s) found = true
}
</b>
</pre>

<h5>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise1')">Exercise 1</a> : 
In what way is the above algorithm inefficient.</h5>

<!-- Blank Space -->
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p>There are many measures of efficiency, but two common measures are
<b>space</b> (amount of memory used) and
<b>time</b>.&nbsp; If we are interested in space efficiency, we can compare the space used by each
of several algorithms that solves the same problem.&nbsp; If one algorithm
requires less space than another, then in some sense, it is better.&nbsp;
For example, consider the following two algorithms for reversing the order
of the elements in an array a[0..n-1].
<blockquote>
<blockquote id="box">
<pre>
<b>
<font color="#3333FF">
//Reverse 1:</font>
for (i = 0; i &lt; (n/2); i++)   // go through half the elements
{
     save = a[i];         //swap 1st with nth, 2nd with n-1st
     a[i] = a[n - i - 1]  //{etc...}
     a[n - i - 1] = save
}

<font color="#3333FF">//Reverse 2:</font>
//Copy the 1st array to a 2nd array but in reverse order.
j = n - 1;        // j runs backward through b[0..n-1]
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
{
     b[j] = a[i]
     j = j - 1
}

// Copy b[0..n-1] into a[0..n-1].
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
    a[i] = b[i]
</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<!-- EXERCISE 2 -->
<h5>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise2')">Exercise 2</a> : Examine Reverse1
and Reverse 2.&nbsp; Which algorithm is more efficient in its use of space?&nbsp; Why?</h5>
As software developers we must be aware of such space inefficiencies and
avoid them.  However, in this lab, we will focus only on time efficiency.

<!-- PART B -->
<center>
<h3>
<a NAME="B"></a>B.&nbsp; Run-time Efficiency</h3></center>
<p>In this lab we will not measure the <i>space</i> efficiency of an algorithm; instead
we will measure the efficiency of an algorithm by estimating its <b>run-time</b>.&nbsp;
<b>Run-time</b> means the time it takes the CPU to execute an implementation
of the algorithm.&nbsp; Run-time is different than the <b>wall-clock-time</b>
required to run your program since there will be start up time, time-sharing
time, I/O time, and so on.&nbsp; The C++ compiler translates a C++ instruction
into a group of machine language instructions (probably about 10 machine
instructions for each C++ instruction).&nbsp; Each computer has a "speed"
often measured in GHz (gigahertz), which shows the machine's speed in billions 
of machine cycles per second.&nbsp; High-powered graphics workstations may
run faster than 3 GHz.&nbsp; PCs often run between 1 and 3 GHz.
&nbsp; Thus wall-clock-time
would depend on what computer was being used.&nbsp; It can also depend
on which compiler is used (one compiler may produce a more efficient set
of machine instructions).&nbsp; It may depend on the time of day and so
on.&nbsp; Thus wall-clock-time is not the best measure to use for "time"
efficiency.
<p>There are many ways to measure "run-time" besides "CPU time of execution."&nbsp;
We could, for instance, count the number of machine instructions that are
executed when the algorithm runs and expect that another algorithm that
requires more machine instructions would be less efficient.&nbsp; This
approach is more appealing as it is machine (speed) independent.&nbsp;
That is, the efficiency of the algorithm is not affected by the speed of
the machine on which you execute it.&nbsp; But who wants to count machine
instructions?
<p>Relatively speaking we could just as well count the C++ instructions
or the pseudo-code steps that are executed as the algorithm runs.&nbsp;
The number of C++ instructions should give us a good measure of the number
of machine instructions.&nbsp; This is how we will measure the run-time
efficiency of an algorithm.&nbsp; Usually the "number of steps" depends
on the number <b>n</b> of inputs to the algorithm.&nbsp; For instance,
if you are searching an array, it will usually take less steps if the size
<b>n</b> of the&nbsp; array is smaller.

<br>&nbsp;

<!-- PART C -->
<center>
<h3>
<a NAME="C"></a>C. A Formal Definition of Big-O Analysis</h3></center>
<p>A notation we use to give an <b>approximation</b> to the run-time efficiency
of an algorithm is called <b>Big-O notation</b> (The O is for order of
magnitude of operations or space at run-time.&nbsp; Some books use Big-Oh.)&nbsp;
First we try to understand the notation.&nbsp; We say a function f(n) (f(n)
is the number of steps executed for an algorithm with <b>n</b> inputs)
is Big-O of g(n) and write
<blockquote><b>f(n) = O(g(n)) (which is read f of n is big
O of g of n or&nbsp; f of n has order g of n)</b></blockquote>
<b>if there exist a positive real value C and a nonnegative integer m such
that</b>
<blockquote><b>| f(n) | &le; C * | g(n) |&nbsp; for all n > m.</b></blockquote>
This means that the number of steps for executing an algorithm for an input
of size <b>n</b> is less than or equal to some positive constant C times
g(n) for all but a few values of n.  For example, 10x + 5 = O(x<sup>2</sup>).
It is also true that 10x + 5 = O(x) (hint:  let C be 20, then
10x + 5 &#8804; 20x for all values of x &#8805; 1/2). 
On the other hand, x<sup>3</sup> &#8800; O(x<sup>2</sup>).  Think about why.
<p>The Big-O of a function is a relative measure of how fast the function
grows with respect to n.&nbsp; To apply Big-O to an algorithm we let f(n)
= the number of steps (or instructions) that are executed when the algorithm
runs on <b>n</b> inputs.&nbsp; There are certain Big-Oh values that occur
frequently in the analysis of algorithms.&nbsp; Here is a partial list
in increasing "size" and the approximate value of |f(n)| for a few values
of <b>n</b>.&nbsp; Notice the change in orders of magnitude.

<blockquote><b><i>O(1)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; means the number of steps to execute
the algorithm is some constant and is not dependent on n the size of the
input. This is called <i>constant time</i>.</b>
<br><b><i>O(log<sub>2 </sub>n)</i>&nbsp; means the number of steps is bounded
by log<sub>2</sub> n.&nbsp; Such an algorithm is very efficient.&nbsp;
This is called <i>logarithmic time</i>.</b>
<br><b><i>O(n)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; means the time is directly proportional
to the size of the input.&nbsp; This is called <i>linear time</i>.</b>
<br><b><i>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; is <i>quadratic time</i>.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;<i>O(n<sup>3</sup>)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; is <i>cubic time</i>.</b>
<br><b><i>O(2<sup>n</sup>)&nbsp;</i>&nbsp; is <i>exponential time</i>.</b></blockquote>
<p>If an algorithm is O(n<sup>m</sup>), for a constant m, it is called a polynomial
time algorithm.&nbsp; A polynomial time algorithm is generally considered
an efficient algorithm (for small values of m).&nbsp; 
Algorithms with exponential time are generally
too inefficient or costly to run on a computer.

<h3>
<a NAME="D"></a>D.&nbsp;&nbsp; Determine the Big-O of an Algorithm</h3></center>
<p>Consider the following algorithm to calculate the sum of the n elements
in an integer array a[0..n-1].
<ol>
<li>
sum = 0</li>

<li>
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)</li>

<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sum += a[i]</li>

<li>
print sum</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider the question:&nbsp; How many steps are executed when this algorithm
runs?
<p>The answer is:&nbsp;&nbsp; 2*n + 3
<p>Why?&nbsp; Line 1 and line 4 execute one time each.&nbsp; Line 3 executes
n times since it lies inside the for loop.&nbsp; Line 2 causes the counter
i to be changed and tested n + 1 times (one extra for the final test when
i = n).&nbsp; Thus the total is:
<ul>
<li>
Line 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</li>

<li>
Line 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</li>

<li>
Line 3:&nbsp; n</li>

<li>
<u>Line 2:&nbsp; n +1</u></li>

<li>
Total:&nbsp; 2n +3</li>
</ul>
<p>The polynomial 2*n + 3 will be dominated by the 1st term as n (the number
of elements in the array) becomes very large.&nbsp; In determining the
Big-O category we ignore constants such as 2 and 3.&nbsp; Therefore the
algorithm above is order n which is written as follows:
<blockquote><b>f(n) = O(n)</b></blockquote>
<p>In other words the run-time of this algorithm increases at roughly the
rate of the size of the inputs (array size) n.
<p>Now consider an algorithm for finding the largest element in a square
two-dimensional array a[0..n-1][0..n-1]
<ol>
<li>
max = a[0][0]</li>

<li>
for (row = 0; row &lt; n; row++)</li>

<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (col = 0; col &lt; n; col++)</li>

<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (a[row][col]
&gt; max)&nbsp; max = a[row][col].</li>

<li>
print max</li>
</ol>
<p>Line 1 and 5 execute one time each.&nbsp; For each execution of line 2
or each time <b>row</b> changes, line 3 executes n+1 times (or <b>col</b>
changes n+1 times) and line 4 executes n times.&nbsp; Since the block of
statements containing lines 3 and 4 executes n times (row = 0 to n-1) we
see the number of steps executed in this algorithm is
<ul>
<li>
Line 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1</li>

<li>
Line 5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1</li>

<li>
Line 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n+1</li>

<li>
Line 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n*(n+1)</li>

<li>
<u>Line 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n*(n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )</u></li>

<li>
Total:&nbsp;&nbsp; 2n<sup>2</sup> + 2n + 3</li>
</ul>
<p>The n<sup>2</sup> term will dominate the polynomial therefore the Big-O
of the algorithm is f(n) = O(n<sup>2</sup>).

<!-- EXERCISE 5 -->
<h5>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise5')">Exercise 5</a> : Let K be the
number of times the while loop executes in the above algorithm.&nbsp; The
number of steps executed is 4 + 3 * K.&nbsp; To see that this is true,
determine how many times each of the lines (1 - 6) is executed and find
the total.</h5>

<!-- Blank Space -->
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p>Now we must determine K.&nbsp; From the algorithm, we see that K is
the largest integer such that 2<sup>K</sup> &lt; n.&nbsp; In other words,
K should be such that 2<sup>K</sup> is approximately equal to n.&nbsp; Suppose for
example that&nbsp; n = 2<sup>K</sup> , then K = log<sub>2</sub>n so we
may say K is approximately log<sub>2</sub>n.&nbsp; Thus the number of steps
executed by this algorithm is approximately (that's all Big-O's are anyway)

<blockquote><b>f(n) = 4 + 3 * K = 4 + 3 * log<sub>2</sub>n
 = O(log<sub>2</sub>n)</b></blockquote>

<!-- EXERCISE 6 -->
<h5>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise6')">Exercise 6</a> : If n = 1000,
approximately how many steps will be executed in the last algorithm?</h5>

<!-- Blank Space -->
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p>In general if the number of steps needed to carry out an algorithm can
be expressed as follows:
<blockquote><b>f(n) = a<sub>k</sub> n<sup>k</sup> + a<sub>k-1</sub> n<sup>k-1</sup>
+ ... + a<sub>1</sub> n<sup>1</sup> + a<sub>0</sub></b></blockquote>
then f(n) is a polynomial in n with degree k and f(n) = O(n<sup>k</sup>).
&nbsp; To obtain the order of a polynomial function we
use the term with the highest degree and disregard any constants and terms
with lower degrees.

<p>To determine the order of an algorithm look at the loops.&nbsp; If
the algorithm contains one loop of the form <b>for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)</b>
then the loop will cause the statements in the loop to be executed n times.&nbsp;
Thus the number of steps is approximately n * the number of instructions
in the loop.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore if the loop causes the most steps to
be executed in the algorithm, then the algorithm is O(n).&nbsp; Nested
loops such as
<blockquote>for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (j = 0; j &lt; n; j++)</blockquote>
are O(n x n) or O(n<sup>2</sup>).

<a NAME="E"></a>E.&nbsp; Best-case, Average-case, and Worst-case Run-time</h3></center>
<p>Some algorithms don't execute a fixed number of steps even for a fixed
value of n.&nbsp; For example, a search algorithm may stop after one step
if it finds the value it is searching for on the first comparison.&nbsp;
On the other hand, it may search through all elements of the array and
still not find the value being sought.&nbsp; In such cases we usually calculate
a <b>best-case</b> (the least number of steps executed for an input of
size n), <b>average-case</b> (the average number of steps executed for
any input of size n), and <b>worst-case</b> (the most number of steps executed
for an input of size n) run-time for the algorithm.
<p>For a sequential search of an array a[0..n] with n elements:
<blockquote>
<blockquote><b>best-case: element searched for appears in 1<sup>st</sup>

<h5>
