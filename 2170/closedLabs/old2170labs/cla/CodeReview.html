Peer Code Review Lab</h1></center>

<font size=small>
In this lab, we will perform a peer learning activity where each student
reviews/assesses the OLA programs written by the other students in the class.
This allows the students to learn from each other in terms of good programming 
styles, documentation, and techniques. 
Students are encouraged to give constructive criticism to help the 
other students to improve their programs in the future.
The program peer review is done anonymously. 

<p> You can view the assessments given by the other students in 
the class when they are finished reviewing your program. 
<p>

Follow the steps below to review programs:
<p>
<ol>
<li> First, log into the ranger system;
<li> Start Firefox from within the ranger system, and log into PeerSpace;
<li> Click on <b>"Tools"</b>, then <b>"Peer Review"</b>;
<li> In this assignment, you are assigned 2 programs to review. Click on <b>"Edit Review"</b> to start reviewing each program. 
<li> In the <b>"Review Assignment"</b> page:
    <ul>
	<li>Viewable Files: You can click on the file names of the <b>"viewable files"</b> to view their content.  
The file is displayed as an image. <b><u>Click on the image to enlarge the file for viewing</b></u>;
	<li>Downloadable Files: You can right click on the file name to download the file. 
        Typically, the downloadable file are executable files or data files. 
        Save them to a designated folder, for example <b>"review"</b>. <br>
        (You may use the Unix command:  mkdir review, to create a new folder).  <br>
         You can then run the downloaded executable program in that folder.
	<li>Assign points to individual items according to the program evaluation rubrics given. 
<u>If you do not give full points to an item, 
you need to give a brief explanation in the space provided about why points are taken.</u>
    </ul>
<li> In the <b>"Feedback Received"</b> page:
    After the other students in the class have finished reviewing your program, you will be able to view the assessments from your students.
<li> Grading for this lab:
	A maximum of 10 bonus points will be given to each reviewer toward his/her OLA score for 
    satisfactorily completing the assigned reviews. This lab does not count toward your CLA grade.
