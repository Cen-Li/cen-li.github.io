<P>In Lab 6, we introduced the <A 
href="javascript:Display('../lab6/lab6.html#C')">C++ class</A> construct which 
is used to define an object.&nbsp; The general form of the <B>class 
specification section</B> could be set up as follows: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE id=box><B><FONT size=3><PRE>class SomeClass
{
public:
       //Data members and methods (function prototypes) are
       //included in this section to provide the public interface
       //of the object (the data and operations
       //which are needed to use the object effectively)
       .
       .
       .

       //which can only be accessed by members of the class.
       .
       .
};

</B></PRE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We also saw that the <B>implementation section</B> for the class contains 
implementations for methods of the class.&nbsp; Short methods can be 
completely defined&nbsp; in the class specification.&nbsp; However, it is 
usually considered better if the class specification is precisely that -- the 
specification of the class.&nbsp; The actual implementation of the class should 
be contained in a separate implementation file.&nbsp; We learned in Lab 6 to 
declare an instance of the class as follows:

	</CENTER>
	<P>With that brief review, we will introduce some addititonal features of the 
  C++ class.&nbsp; Consider the <I>Clock</I> class which we discussed in Lab 
  6.&nbsp; If we wished to declare a <I>Clock</I> object and then initialize the 
  data members in the object, we would first have to declare the object: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>Clock yourClock;</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The 
  <B>Clock</B> object, <B>yourClock</B>,&nbsp; could now be initialized by 
  calling the <B>setClock() </B>member function.&nbsp; Initializing 
  <B>yourClock</B>&nbsp; to the time 10:15:00 am could be accomplished as 
  follows: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>yourClock.setClock (10,15,0,&quot;AM&quot;);</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>There is nothing wrong with this method of declaring and initializing an 
  object.&nbsp; However, there is a more convenient way to initialize the data 
  members of an object when defining the object.&nbsp; C++ includes special 
  provisions for such initializations.&nbsp; When a class is defined, a special 
  member function called a <B>constructor</B> can be used.&nbsp; A 
  <B><I>constructor</I></B> is a member function that is automatically called 
  when an object of that class is declared.&nbsp; A constructor may be used to 
  initialize the values of data members and to do any other initialization that 
  may be needed. 
  <P>For example, consider the <I>ifstream</I> class.&nbsp; When we declare an 
  input file stream as: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>ifstream ins;</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	an instance of 
  the <I>ifstream</I> class is created.&nbsp; The statement 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>ins.open ("myfile.dat");</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	is a 
  call to the member function "open" which connects the input file stream <B>ins</B> 
  to the file "myfile.dat".&nbsp; The following shows an alternate way to 
  declare an input file stream <B><I>and</I></B> to open the stream at declaration 
  time: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B><FONT size=3>
	<PRE>ifstream ins("myfile.dat");</PRE>
	</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This second form of declaration and initialization 
  uses a "constructor" of the class <I>ifstream</I>. 
  <P>Suppose we wish to declare an instance of a Clock <B><I>and</I></B> 
  initialize the Clock to the time 10:15:00 am at declaration time.&nbsp; If we 
  had an appropriate constructor, we could type: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>Clock yourClock (10,15,0,&quot;AM&quot;);</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>We now need to learn how to define a constructor (a special method) to allow us to use the above statement.&nbsp; A constructor is 
  defined the same way as other member functions, except for two rules: 
  <OL>
	<LI>A constructor must have the same name as the class.&nbsp; For example, 
    for the Clock class, any constructor for this class must be named 
    Clock().&nbsp; Similarly for the Loan class, any constructor must be named 
    Loan(). 
    <LI>A constructor is a function which cannot return a value.&nbsp; Thus no 
    type, not even void, can be given at the start of the method or 
    in the function header. </LI>
	</OL>
	<P>Let us consider a modified version of the Clock class declaration: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE id=box>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>class Clock
{
public:
     //function prototypes of member functions (methods)
     //in the public interface
     
     //class constructor which initializes the clock to
     //h hours, m minutes, s seconds and meridian (am or pm).
     <span class="style1">Clock(int h, int m, int s, atring mer);</span>

     //Set the clock to the specified time
     void setClock (int h, int m, int s, string mer);

     //Display the time in standard notation
     void displayStandard();

     //Display the time in military notation
     void displayMilitary();

private:
     //declarations of data members that are private
     int hr,           //an hour in the range 1 - 12
         min,          //a minute in the range 0 - 59
         sec,          //a second in the range 0 - 59
     string meridian;  //is the time&nbsp; AM (0) or PM (1)
};
</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Note that the name of the constructor is <B><I>Clock()</I></B>, the same as 
  the name of the class.&nbsp; Also note that the prototype for the constructor 
  	<B>Clock</B> does not start with void or with any other type.&nbsp; Finally 
  note that the constructor is placed in the public section of the class 
  specification.&nbsp; Normally, you should make your constructors public methods so all clients may access the constructor. 
  <P>With the redefined Clock class, two objects of type Clock can be declared 
  <B>and</B> initialized as follows: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>Clock yourClock (10, 15, 0, &quot;AM&quot;);</PRE>
		</FONT></B><BR>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>Clock myClock (1, 30, 45, &quot;PM&quot;);</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Assuming 
  that the implementation of the constructor performs the initializing actions 
  promised, the declaration above would declare <I>yourClock</I> to have the 
  time 10:15:00 am and <I>myClock</I> to have the time 1:30:45 pm. 
  <P>The implementation of a constructor is given in the same way as any other 
  method.&nbsp; The implementation of the Clock constructor would 
  appear as follows: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE id=box>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>//Class constructor which initializes the clock to
//h hours, m minutes, s seconds and am or pm.
Clock::Clock(int h, int m, int s, string mer)
{
     //hr, min, sec, and ampm are declared in the private 
     //section of the class
     hr = h;
     min = m;
     sec = s;
     meridian = mer;
}
</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Since the class and the constructor have the same name, the name 
  	<B>Clock</B> occurs twice in the function heading.&nbsp; The <I>Clock 
  </I><B>before</B> the scope resolution operator<B> ::</B> is the <B>name of 
  the class</B> and
	<I>Clock</I> <B>after</B> the scope resolution operator 
  is the <B>name of the constructor function</B>.&nbsp; Note that there is no 
  return type specified in the function heading. 
  <p>In our clock example, the constructor has parameters to allow the hours, minutes, seconds,
  and meridian to be set.  A constructor does not have to have any parameters.  If the constructor
  has no parameters, it is called the <b>default constructor</b>. Often a default constructor is provided
  to set the data members to default values.  The implementation for a default constructor for the clock class might look like:</p>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE id=box>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>
		//The default  constructor sets the time on the clock
		//to 12:00:00 am
		Clock::Clock()
		{
			hr = 12;
			min = 0;
			sec = 0;
			meridian = "AM"
		}
		</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>To create an instance of the Clock class using the default constructor, the following statement might appear
in a main program:</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>Clock myClock;
				</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>Notice that there are no parenthesis after myClock to indicate that a function with no arguments is
being called.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just remember that this is how the default constructor 
is activated.&nbsp; </p>

  <CENTER>
	<H3><A name=C></A>C. Overloaded Functions</H3>
	</CENTER>
	<P>In the English language, a word may have more than one meaning.&nbsp; We 
  determine the meaning of a word by considering the context in which the word 
  appears.&nbsp; For example, the word <B>string</B> has two meanings -- an 
  object possibly made from twine which might be used to tie around another 
  object or (in computer science) just a sequence of characters.&nbsp; We have 
  no problem determining which meaning is intended when we consider the 
  following sentences: 
  <DL>
	<DD>Tie the <B><I>string</I></B> around the package so it can be 
    mailed.<BR>
	A <B><I>string</I></B> would be used to represent a word in a 
    dictionary. </DD>
	</DL>
	<P>Similarly, functions may have more than one meaning in C++.&nbsp; When this 
  is the case, we say we have an <B>overloaded</B> function.&nbsp; Thus, the 
  same function name may be defined more than once with different formal 
  parameters. 
  <P>In C++, we can overload functions and operators by providing multiple 
  definitions for the function or operator. The compiler determines which 
  definition is intended by the context in which the function or operator 
  occurs.&nbsp; Suppose we wished to have two meanings for a function called 
  <B>ave () </B>which would average numbers and we provide the following 
  definitions: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>//Find the average of two integers
float ave (int a, int b)
{
     return float (a+b)/2.0;

     return float (sum) / n;
}
</PRE>

	The main function might have the

  <BLOCKQUOTE>

int x[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

     &lt;&lt; endl;
cout &lt;&lt; "The average of the integers 10, 20, 30, 40,"

</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>As you can see the meaning of the function <B><I>ave()</I></B> is 
  completely determined by the context (what arguments are sent to the 
  function).&nbsp; This property of functions with multiple meanings is called 
  	<B>overloading</B>.&nbsp; Overloading is an example of <B>polymorphism</B>, a 
  term derived from a Greek word meaning <I>"many forms"</I>.&nbsp; The use of 
  the same function name to mean different things is called polymorphism.&nbsp; 
  We will see that polymorphism is very important in defining objects. <!--EXERCISE 5 ---->

  Class</H3>
	</CENTER>
	<P>A constructor is called automatically when an object is declared.&nbsp; In 
  Lab 6, the Clock class and the Date class did not include a constructor.&nbsp; 
  When a class does not include a constructor, the compiler automatically 
  creates a default constructor for the class and leaves the data members 
	uninitialized.&nbsp; Thus when the statement 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>Date christmas;</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	was used, the compiler provided a default constructor. 
  <P>Using constructors is an all or nothing situation.&nbsp; If the class 
  contains a constructor, then every time an object of that type is declared, 
  C++ looks for an appropriate constructor definition in the class.&nbsp; Thus 
  the following declaration would be illegal for the modified Clock class that 
	did not contain the default constructor but did contain a different 
	constructor: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<FONT color=#ff0000 size=3>
		<PRE><strong>Clock newClock;     //ILLEGAL declaration</strong><B>
</PRE>
		</B>
		</FONT>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>The reason this statement is illegal is that since&nbsp; the Clock class 
  contains a constructor, the compiler will not create a default 
  constructor.&nbsp; Instead the Clock class is searched for a constructor which 
  requires no arguments.&nbsp; Since the class only has one constructor which 
  requires four arguments, this is an illegal declaration.&nbsp;&nbsp; To allow 
  a statement such as the one above, a constructor must be added (an overloaded 
  function) which requires no arguments. 
  <P>A constructor with no arguments is called a <B>default</B> constructor 
  because it applies in the default case when an object is declared without 
  specifying any arguments.&nbsp; Since it is likely that an object will be 
  declared without giving any arguments, a default constructor should <B>almost 
  always</B> be included with the class.&nbsp; The default constructor for the 
  Clock class might be: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>Clock::Clock ()
{}
</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Notice that this default constructor does nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; All data 
  values are left uninitialized.&nbsp; In some cases, the default constructor 
  would be used to initialize appropriate data members to default values.&nbsp; 
  If the overloaded constructor above were added to the Clock class and the 
  statement: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>Clock newClock;</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	appeared in a 
  C++ program, it would be a legal statement and the default constructor would 
  be called.&nbsp; In summary, two points can be made about supplying default 
  constructors: 
  <OL>
	<LI>If a class defines no constructor at all, then a default constructor 
    that does nothing is automatically supplied. 
    <LI>If a class defines any constructor, then the default constructor is not 
    automatically supplied.&nbsp; If a default constructor is needed, an 
    appropriate one <B>must</B> be given explicitly. </LI>
	</OL>
	<P>As a second example of using overloaded constructors in a class definition, 
  suppose we wished to have a default constructor to set the time of a 
  <I>Clock</I> object to 12:00 am so that any of the following declarations 
  would work. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<PRE><B>
Clock myClock(10, 15, 0, &quot;PM&quot;);
Clock yourClock;
</B></PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>The default constructor would now be: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<PRE><B>
//Class constructor which initializes the clock to
//12:00 am.
Clock::Clock()
{
    hr = 12;
    min = 0;
    sec = 0;
    meridian = &quot;am&quot;;
}
</B></PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>It should be noted that you <B>cannot</B> have two default constructors. <!--EXERCISE 8 ----->

	<H3><A name=E></A>E.&nbsp; Overloaded Operators</H3>
	</CENTER>
	<P>Not only can functions be overloaded but operators, such as <B>==</B>, 
  <B>!=</B>, <B>+</B>, etc., can also be overloaded.&nbsp; In fact this feature 
  has been used anytime the <B>same</B> operator is used for 
  <B><I>different</I></B> types.&nbsp; For example: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>int num1, num2;
Clock clock1, clock2;

//assume that the integer num2 and the Clock clock2 have
//been initialized

//first use of the operator "=" between integer operands
num1 = num2;

//second use of the operator "=" between Clock operands
clock1 = clock2;
</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>The operator "=" is used twice -- once between two integers and once 
  between two Clock objects.&nbsp; The operator is used to replace the integer 
  	<I>num1</I> by the integer <I>num2</I> in the first instance.&nbsp; In the 
  second instance, the <I>hr</I>, <I>min</I>, <I>sec</I>, and <I>meridian</I> data 
  in <I>clock1</I> is replaced by the <I>hr</I>, <I>min</I>, <I>sec</I> and 
  <I>meridian</I> data of&nbsp; <I>clock2</I>. 
  <P>We might also wish to overload other operators such as <B>!=</B>, 
  <B>&lt;</B>, <B>&gt;</B> so that we could do the following for example: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>Clock yourClock, myClock;
.
.
.
if (yourClock != myClock)
     cout &lt;&lt; "Your clock is wrong.\n";
</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>We cannot use the operator <B>!=</B> between two Clock objects without 
  first defining what this would mean.&nbsp; C++ does provide a default 
  definition of the operator <B>=</B> but does not provide a definition for 
  other operators.&nbsp; When the operator = is used between two objects of a 
  class, C++ copies the data members of the class on the right of the = to the 
  class on the left. 
  <P>C++ considers an operator to be a function, so an operator can be 
  overloaded also.&nbsp; Overloading an operator, such as !=, is very similar to 
  overloading a function.&nbsp; To overload the != operator, the following 
  function prototype would be included in the Clock specification section. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>bool operator != (Clock rhs);</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>As can be seen, an operator function named "<B><I>operator</I></B> <I>op</I>" overloads the operator 
	<I>op</I>.&nbsp; Thus the function 
  <B><I>operator !=(&nbsp;)</I></B> overloads the operator <B><I>!=</I></B>, the 
  function <B><I>operator &lt; (&nbsp;)</I></B> would overload the operator 
  <B><I>&lt;</I></B> and so on.&nbsp; There are some restrictions: 
  <UL>
	<LI>At least one argument which is used as an operand must be of a 
    user-defined type because the meaning of an operator for built-in types 
    cannot be changed. 
    <LI>The number of arguments (used as operands) for an operator cannot be 
    changed.&nbsp; When we consider the operator &lt;, it has two arguments used 
    as operands because the usage is "lhs &lt; rhs". </LI>
	</UL>
	<P>The implementation of the function operator != for the Clock class follows 
  below: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE id=box>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>bool Clock::operator != (Clock rhs)
{
     bool notequal = false;

     //hr, min, sec, meridian are private data members of the lhs clock
     if ((hr != rhs.hr)||(min != rhs.min)||(sec != rhs.sec)||(meridian != rhs.meridian))
          notequal = true;
     return notequal;
}
</PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<p>Now if this overloaded operator were used to compare two instances
	of the clock class as below, myClock would be passed to the method above as an actual argument
	to the method.  The object yourClock would be passed the message to compare itself with the 
	argument to the right of the !=.  </p>
	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>Clock yourClock, myClock;

<p>We have introduced two new types of methods in the book class above.  The first is a

An accessor method allows the client access to an individual data member.
The second is a <strong>set</strong> or <strong>mutator </strong>method.  A mutator allows the client to change a data member within reason.
The Book class has ultimate control over what is placed into a data member.  For example, in the mutator for the
ISBN number, the Book class 
might check to see if the ISBN number is a valid number before assigning it to
the data member.  </p>

	<H3><A name=G></A>G.&nbsp; Array of Objects</H3>
	</CENTER>

	<p>A client must often work with an array of objects.&nbsp; For example suppose that a client is working with an array of books as follows:</p>
	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>
Book arrayOfBooks[10];
    </PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>When this array of books is created, the default constructor is activated for all 10 Book objects that are
in the array.  Thus the class must have a default constructor or the compiler must provide one.</p>
<p>If the client wished to read the array of books, it might be read using the code below:</p>
	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<B><FONT size=3>
		<PRE>
string author, title, ISBN;

//read the data for 10 books
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
{
	cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Please enter the author, title, and ISBN for book &quot; &lt;&lt; i  &lt;&lt; endl;
	
	//read the author, title, and ISBN -- these might contain spaces so use getline
	getline (cout, author);
	getline (cout, title);
	getline (cout, ISBN);
	
	//put the author, title, and ISBN into the ith book object
	arrayOfBooks[i].setAuthor(author);
	arrayOfBooks[i].setTitle(title);
	arrayOfBooks[i].setISBN(ISBN);
}
	 
    </PRE>
		</FONT></B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>Notice in the code above that using an array of objects is similar to using an array of structs.  The
index in the array appears first so that the compiler can determine which object is to be used.  Next
the method that is being used with that object appears.  If we wanted to set the title of the 0th book in
the array to "The Firm"  then we would use the notation <pre>arrayOfBooks[0].setTitle("The Firm");</pre></P>
