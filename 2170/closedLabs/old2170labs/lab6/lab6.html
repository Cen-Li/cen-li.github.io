&nbsp;   
<p>Previously, we have viewed software development using functions operating on 
data (or structured programming). The emphasis was creating the functions.
Beginning In this lab, we will place an emphasis upon the data and the 
associated operations that are performed upon the data.
This approach to software development
is called object-oriented programming (OOP). <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;   <!-- PART A ------> </p>
<center> 
<h3> <a name="A"></a>A. Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
</center>
  
<p>In the OOP approach, software objects (often called abstract data types) are used.&nbsp; An  <b>object</b> 
is a self-contained computing entity with its own data and
its associated operations.&nbsp; In real life, we deal with physical
objects all the time.&nbsp; When we sit in our chair (an object) at our desk
(an object), we might consult our calendar (an object) to see what we must
do today.&nbsp; Then we might make a few calls using our phone (an object)
after consulting our phone book (an object) to look up numbers and so on. 
</p>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) mimics real life situations by building 
software using software objects.&nbsp; The idea is to use software to model objects 
that closely correspond to real objects in the application.&nbsp; Thus in
our example above, we could visualize both the calendar and the phone book
and possibly the desk as software objects.&nbsp; Probably "today" would be
a date object as well. </p>
<p>In the object-oriented approach to programming, a problem is decomposed 
into a well-defined set of objects that can be used to model&nbsp; the application.&nbsp;
Once the objects are determined, consideration is given to exactly what data
each will encapsulate(represent) and what operations are associated with the data.&nbsp;
Finally the relationships among the objects are established. <br>

<br>
<hr>
<br>
 
According to Wang <a href="#1">[1]</a>,  
OOP has several advantages:

<blockquote><i>Simplicity</i>:&nbsp; Because software objects model real world
objects in the application domain, the complexity of the program is reduced
and the program structure is more clear and simple. <br>
  <br>
  <i>Reusability</i>:&nbsp; Objects can be reused in different programs.&nbsp; 
A table-building object, for instance, can be used in any program that requires
a table of some sort.&nbsp; Thus, programs can be built from prefabricated 
and pretested components in a fraction of the time required to build new programs
from scratch. <br>
  <br>
  <i>Maintainability</i>:&nbsp; Objects can be maintained separately, making
locating and fixing problems and adding "bells and whistles" easy.</blockquote>
  
<p>Several languages have been developed which are OOP languages.&nbsp; One
such language is Smalltalk.&nbsp; It is considered to be a <b>pure</b> object-oriented
language, a language in which everything is an object.&nbsp; All actions
in a pure object-oriented language are produced by passing messages.
A <b>message</b> is a request sent to an object to perform an operation
on its data.&nbsp; Other languages like C++ are called <b>hybrid</b>
languages because they support a combination of object-oriented and traditional
structured programming. Our usage of C++ up to this point has concentrated upon the structured aspect of C++.</p>
<p>C++ was designed by Bjarne Stroustrup of AT&amp;T Bell Labs in the early 
1980s.&nbsp; It was designed to incorporate the object-oriented paradigm into
the C programming language.&nbsp; C++ has become a predominant OOP language
because it provides a well-designed set of language constructs which fully
support OOP programming.&nbsp; Secondly, it is an extension of the popular,
standardized ANSI C.

<p>In the next section of our closed lab, we will introduce C++ objects and start using them in our 
problem solving.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;  <!--PART B --------> </p>
<center> 
<h3> <a name="B"></a>B. Data Encapsulation</h3>
</center>
 
<p>First consider a real world object that most of us use -- an automobile.&nbsp; We know that 
each automobile is described by its make (such as GM, Ford, Honda, Toyota), 
model, type (such as two door, four door, sedan, SUV, van), year (when it 
was made by a particular manufacturer), an engine, 
a transmission (
either a straight shift or automatic) and so on. This set of features
can be thought of as "data" features describing an automobile object. Actually, 
most view  the engine and transmission as objects in their own right, i.e., as
subobjects, but they are still data features of the automobile object.
The automobile object also has certain functions or "operations" which
it can perform. We can "start" the automobile;
we can "drive" the automobile; we can move forward; we can move in reverse;
we can stop the automobile.
It doesn't matter
what kind of an automobile we have, we can hopefully depend on certain basic
functions and features (data) being built in.&nbsp; This wrapping together
of data features and functions is an example of encapsulation.&nbsp; This
situation is analogous to the concept of <b>data encapsulation</b> which
we use in computing.&nbsp; Using this concept we view the object which consists of
the data plus the functions (also called methods or operations)
on these data items as "encapsulated" or bound together in a single program
unit. </p>
<p>The operations may require certain inputs to obtain
the desired results. For example, to "start" the car, we must have it
in the correct gear.  We must have the correct ignition key.
If we use the wrong key or don't have the automobile in the correct
gear, the automobile won't start. Similarly in computing, the operations
associated with an object may require certain inputs/parameters
before the correct results will be obtained.

<hr>
  
<p>We consider the automobile as a machine whose internal workings are not
normally visible.&nbsp; When we insert the correct key in the ignition and
turn it, the car starts.&nbsp; What goes on inside the engine is unknown
and unimportant to the driver as long as the car starts.&nbsp; We use this concept in computing
also.&nbsp; The process of "hiding" implementation details from a higher-level
module (the automobile driver in our example)  is called <b>information hiding</b>.&nbsp; When we use an object,
we are normally concerned with how to interface with the object (the public
interface) rather than with the internal workings of the object.&nbsp; The
<b>public interface</b> of an object is composed of the collection of functions
and features which allow us to use the object.&nbsp; This public
interface completely defines how the object can be used (similar to a manual which
comes with our automobile describing how to operate and maintain the vehicle).&nbsp;
The public interface to the car object includes details on "starting" the
car, putting the car in "drive", and in "reverse".&nbsp; Each object also has internal
data and functions that are available via the 
 <b>private interface</b>
which is not the same as the public interface. This is like when your 
check engine light comes on; you look in your owners manual and are told 
to take the automobile to the dealer for repairs. In other words, how to
"repair" the engine is not part of the public interface but is part of the 
private interface known by the dealer.
Likewise, an object organizes data and related operations into
a collective structure which can hide the internal workings of the object 
from public view, i.e., cannot be seen/used via the public interface.  <!--EXERCISE 5 -----> </p>

<p>As previously described, software objects are used to closely model actual objects 
in a real problem to be solved.&nbsp; In C++, the <b>class</b> construct is
used to model real objects. By using the C++ class definition, the data and associated
operations can be collected (encapsulated) into one unit, i.e., a class. </p>
<p>As an example, consider a "clock" that we might use to maintain 
and display the time of day. We could use this "clock" in any software 
in which the time of day was necessary. Of course, the "clock" 
consists of the data plus associated operations. 
Thus a clock might be viewed as: <br>

Terminology:
<br>
<p><i>instance variable</i> -- is a variable declared as part of the class, i.e., a member variable.  Each object of the class has a copy of the variable.</p>
<p><i>message</i> -- We previously defined a <i>message</i> as a request sent to 
an object to perform some operation. For example, the remark "start" 
is a request/message sent to the automobile (operator). As another example, a request 
by you to the MTSU records office to send a transcript to a potential employer is a 
message, i.e., your request to MTSU is the message. MTSU is the object of the request.
<p><i>method</i> -- It is the internal implementation/representation of an 
object operation. For now, you can think of a method as a function. How your 
transcript request is handled internally by MTSU relates to what "methods" MTSU
uses to process your request. For the clock 
example, the internal function used for "setClock" is an example of a method.  If
you request that a clock be set to say 1pm, then your request is a message
(because it comes from a source external to the actual clock) that is acted upon
by an internal method (setClock in this case with parameters 1,0,0,"pm"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically a "message" and "method" have the same name. A message is a request 
sent by an external source to an object and the object responds by invoking a method
of the same name IF that method is available via the public interface. 
<p><i>object</i> -- is an instance of class. As an example of the concept of class 
and object, consider our automobile example. Previously we provided a generic 
description of all automobiles, i.e., a list of possible features such as make, 
model, type, year, engine, and transmission along with operations: start, drive, 
reverse, and stop. This is analogous to a class definition. Now if we provide 
the features associated with your automobile such as Ford, Escort, 2-door, 2004, 
3.0 Liter, 5-speed automatic,etc. then your specific automobile is an 
instance/example of the automobile class. 

<p>Given a clock object, we could set our clock to say 1:30:45 pm,&nbsp; by sending a request (message) to the  method <i>setClock</i> 
with arguments for the hour, minute, second and whether it is am or pm.&nbsp; The
actual representation of the data is hidden from the user.&nbsp; After setting the clock to 1:30:45pm, sending the
message&nbsp; <i>displayStandard</i> would cause the time to be displayed&nbsp; 
in the form 1:30:45 pm.

<h3> <a name="D"></a>D.&nbsp; C++ Class Syntax</h3>
</center>
 
<p>How do we implement the "clock" using C++? 
This is accomplished with the C++ <b>class</b> construct.&nbsp; Normally a class 
definition is separated into two sections: <b>specification</b> and <b>implementation</b>.
To simplify our view, we will first give the class definition as one unit.  
Then we will separate our definition into two parts: specification and implementation, and we will place these in separate files.
Below is the complete definition of the class called <b>Clock</b> given as one unit. 
 </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote id="box">
<pre>
<font size=3>
<b>
#include &lt;iostream>  // this is needed because of
using namespace std; // the "cout" below.

//The Clock class definition starts here. 
// Again, given here as one unit for clarity where 
// as normally this definition would be divided 
// into two parts: specification and implementation
// and written in separate files.  

class Clock 
{ 
  private:
    //declarations of data members that are private
    int hour;          //an hour in the range 1 - 12
    int minute,        //a minute in the range 0 - 59
    int second;        //a second in the range 0 - 59
    string meridian;   //is the time AM or PM

  public: 
    // publically accessible methods, i.e., the public interface 

    //Set the clock to the specified time 
    void setClock (int h, int m, int s, string mer)
    {
       hour = h;
       minute = m;
       second = s; 
       meridian = mer;
    }

    //Display the time in standard notation
    void displayStandard()
    {
      cout << hour<<':'&lt;&lt;minute<<':'&lt;&lt;second<<' ' << meridian ;
    }

    //Display the time in military notation
    void displayMilitary()
    {
      int militaryHour = hour;
  
      //if it is pm and it isn't 12:00 noon, then add 
      //12 hours to the time
      if (meridian == "PM" && hour != 12)
          militaryHour += 12;

      //if it is 12:00 midnight, then subtract 12 hours
      if (meridian == "AM" && hour == 12)
          militaryHour -= 12;

      cout << militaryHour << ':' << minute <<  ':' << second;		  
    }

};
//The Clock class definition ends with the closing brace and semicolon.
</b>
</font>
</pre> 
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
  
<p>As you can see, the class definition begins with the line
with the C++ reserved word <b>class</b> and consists of everything between
the opening brace, {, up to and including the semicolon after the closing
brace, }.&nbsp; This definition includes a <b>public</b> and a <b>private</b> section.&nbsp;
The public section describes the public interface of the class (remember
the car manual).&nbsp; The public interface includes variables, types, constants,
and methods (functions) that a programmer needs to know to use the class.&nbsp;
The private section includes variables, constants, data types, and methods (functions)
which are to be hidden (not to be used) by other program components
except those in the class definition.&nbsp; Whether in the public or private
section, variables and constants are referred to as <b>data members </b>and
functions are referred to as <b>methods</b>. </p>
<hr>
<p>As previously noted, the data and method prototypes for a class are normally 
placed in a <b>.h</b> file and is included in appropriate program files when 
the class definition is used. The implementation of the methods is usually placed 
in a <b>.cpp</b> file.
<p>In the above example, for clarity both were placed in one file/block of code. We 
will now change this by dividing the "clock" class definition into the 
specification and implementation files. What follows is the 
<a href="javascript:Display('$CLA/clock.h')"><b>clock.h</b></a> file. 

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote id="box">
<pre>
<font size=3>
<b>
#include &lt;iostream>  // this is needed because of

    int hour;          //an hour in the range 1 - 12
    int minute;        //a minute in the range 0 - 59
    int second;        //a second in the range 0 - 59
    string meridian;   //is the time AM or PM

public: 
    // publically accessible methods,i.e., public interface 

    //Set the clock to the specified time 
    void setClock (int h, int m, int s, string mer);

    void displayStandard();
    //Display the time in military notation
    void displayMilitary();
};
</b>
</font>
</pre> 
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The following is the implementation portion of the class definition. It is placed
in the file 
<a href="javascript:Display('$CLA/clock.cpp')"> <b>clock.cpp</b> </a> 
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote id="box">

       minute = m;
       second = s; 
       meridian = mer;
    }

    //Display the time in standard notation
    void Clock::displayStandard()
    {
      cout << hour<<':'&lt;&lt;minute<<':'&lt;&lt;second<<' ' << meridian ;

          militaryHour += 12;

      //if it is 12:00 midnight, then subtract 12 hours

      cout << militaryHour << ':' << minute <<  ':' << second;
    }

</b>
</font>
</pre> 
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

The "clock.h" file can be included in any program file with the #include
directive: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote><b>#include "clock.h"</b></blockquote>
 </blockquote>
 
<p>The ".h" file needs to be included in
any main program that utilizes the clock class.&nbsp; The implementation section
of the clock class should be placed in a different ".cpp" file other than the 
file containing the
main function.&nbsp; Thus both the clock implementation file and the main function
file must have the #include "clock.h" directive.&nbsp; However, if an application program
includes this header file more than once, the compiler issues an error message
that there is an attempt to redefine a type.&nbsp; We can avoid this problem/error,
by surrounding the clock specification definition
with preprocessor-directives as follows: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote id="box">
<pre>
<font size=3>
<b>
//Eliminate the problem of multiple inclusions 
#ifndef CLOCK_H
#define CLOCK_H
    
//the class definitions come here
.
.
.
#endif
</b>
</font>
</pre>
</blockquote>
 </blockquote>
 
<p>Before <a href="javascript:Display('$CLA/clock.h')">clock.h</a> is 
included initially, the constant <b>CLOCK_H</b> is not defined.&nbsp; Thus 
the #define directive causes the constant <b>CLOCK_H</b> and the class <b>Clock</b> 
to become defined.&nbsp; For subsequent inclusions, the preprocessor notes 
that <b>CLOCK_H</b> has a definition and does not pass the remainder of the
file to the compiler so the <b>Clock</b> class is not redefined.

 </blockquote>
  
<p>As you can see from this method definition, we are just defining the function 
(method), setClock, which appears in the clock.cpp file.
Note that the method has direct access to the private data members of the
class such as hour, minute, second, and meridian. Methods outside the class 
implementation file do not have this access! One difference
between methods in the implementation file and functions outside the 
implementation file is the function heading.&nbsp;
Consider the setClock heading. </p>

in which setClock is a method. The operator <b>::</b> is called 
the <b>scope resolution</b> operator.&nbsp; It is possible for several different
classes to have member functions with the same name.&nbsp; The scope resolution
operator is like the <b>dot</b> operator that was introduced (and we will
see again shortly) in the <a
 href="javascript:Display('../lab5/lab5.html#B')">lab on structs</a>.&nbsp;
The scope resolution operator is used to tell the compiler to what class
a member function belongs.&nbsp; Thus when <b>Clock::</b> precedes the name
of the function setClock, we automatically know that setClock is a member
function in the class Clock. </p>

<font color="BB2222">Write the
implementation section for the date object which was defined in Exercise
6 and 7.&nbsp; Place this in the file <i>date.cpp</i>.</font>
<hr>
  

<p>Now, how can we use this class specification and implementation in a 
program? 
Consider the following main program that uses our Clock class.
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote id="box">
<pre>
<font size=3>
<b>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include "clock.h"
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    //Declare two Clock objects
    Clock myClock, newClock;

    //Set the time of myClock to 12:45:30 am.
    myClock.setClock(12, 45, 30, "am");

    //Set the time of the newClock object to 2:15:30 pm.
    newClock.setClock (2, 15, 30, "pm"); 

    //Display the time of myClock in both standard and
    //military format
    cout &lt;&lt; "The time on the Digital Clock (in standard form) is: "
    myClock.displayStandard(); 
    
    cout &lt;&lt; "\nThe time in military format is: ";
    myClock.displayMilitary(); 
    
    //Set the two times to the same time
    myClock = newClock;

    //Display the time of myClock in standard time  
    cout &lt;&lt; "The time on the Digital Clock (in standard form) is: "
    myClock.displayStandard(); 
 
    return 0; 
}
</b>
</font>
</pre>
  </blockquote>
 </blockquote>
  
<p>Notice that the <b>dot</b> operator is used to select a particular member
function (method) to invoke.&nbsp; This is how "messages" are passed to an object
in C++.&nbsp; Thus, </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote><b><pre><font size=3>myClock.setClock(12,45,30,"am");</font></pre></b></blockquote>
 </blockquote>
 sends the setClock message to the object myClock. 
<p>In the above function, the assignment statement: 
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote><b><pre><font size=3>myClock = newClock;</font></pre></b></blockquote>
 </blockquote>
This line is valid and copies all data fields from the object newClock to
the object myClock.&nbsp; It is valid and accomplishes what we desire in
this example because we have simple data types making up the two objects. 
</p>
<p>Note that nowhere in our main function do we try to access the data variables
<i>hour</i>, <i>second</i>, <i>minute</i>, and <i>meridian</i> which were defined in the Clock class.&nbsp;

In fact, we could not do so because these data members were placed in the
private section of the class which means that only members of the class can
access them.&nbsp; Thus we <b>could not</b> incorporate the following statements
in the main function: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote><b><font size = 3 color="red"><pre>
//This is an invalid member access
myClock.hour = 2;
</pre></font></b></blockquote>
 </blockquote>
