<h3>Introduction</h3>
</center>
You have been asked to solved a problem; you have designed a solution, 
and you have implemented the solution in C++. 
Inaddtion, you have compiled the implemented solution and there are no
syntax errors reported.
Next you execute your program, but it does not work correctly.
Perhaps it gives incorrect answers or goes into an infinite loop or it aborts
with a message such as the following:

<blockquote><b>segmentation fault: core dumped</b></blockquote>
<p>For whatever reason, the outcome of executing the program does not
produce the expected/desired results. 
Historically nonsyntax errors in programs are called "<b>bugs</b>."&nbsp;
The term bug was first coined by Grace Hopper, the creator of COBOL (COmmon Business Oriented Language)
and the first assembly language.&nbsp; In 1945, the famous Mark I
computer came to a halt.&nbsp; Workers found a
moth inside the computer, removed the offending beast and the computer
was
fine!&nbsp; From then on, all mysterious problems with computing were
called bugs.
<br>
<br>

&nbsp;<!-- PART A ------> </p>

<center>
<h3> <a name="A"></a>A. Program Bugs/Errors</h3>
</center>
<p>There are numerous famous bugs in computing and the list grows longer each year.&nbsp; For example, the
Russians lost a space ship in mid-flight when an erroneous command
transmitted from mission control sent the space ship into a test
routine from which it never recovered.&nbsp; This could have easily been prevented if had been
some safety "switch" that prevented the accidental execution of such a
test sequence. </p>
<p>A multi-million dollar X-ray machine killed at least two people by
administering
excessive doses of radiation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cause of the error was
traced
to a certain sequence of editing commands.&nbsp; One day programmers
may
need "malpractice insurance" like physicians do today to protect
themselves
in such situations. </p>

<p>Can bugs be avoided?&nbsp; Yes and no.&nbsp; Software Engineering is
dedicated
to developing techniques for building better software.&nbsp; Our goal
is
to be as good at building software as an engineer is at building a
bridge.&nbsp;
Bridges rarely fail just as software should rarely fail.&nbsp; To help
reduce
errors in software, we have developed <b>paradigms</b> of software
development.&nbsp;
A paradigm is a method with all its related steps and techniques (i.e.,
an
approach).&nbsp; In the 1970's, a software development paradigm called
the

<b>Waterfall</b> paradigm was developed.&nbsp; It was so named because
each
step or phase supplies information to the next like water flows over a
waterfall.&nbsp;
The phases are as follows: <br>

<p>In the <b>analysis phase</b>, requirements describing what the
software product is to do are determined by interviewing the
client.&nbsp; The requirements are analyzed and a specifications
document is produced.&nbsp; In the <b>design phase</b>, the
specifications document is turned into an architectural design
in which the software is broken down into modules.&nbsp; The modules
are
designed in a more detailed fashion that focuses on procedural
detail.&nbsp; The data structures are defined at this point.&nbsp;
During the <b>implementation phase</b>, the modules are coded and
tested.&nbsp; The modules are integrated and tested as a whole in the <b>testing
phase</b>.&nbsp; The <b>maintenance phase</b> includes making changes
to the software including corrections and
enhancements.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many methods such as step-wise refinement and
structured
programming have been developed to improve the process of software
development.&nbsp;

We will focus in this lab (and in this course) on the Waterfall
paradigm
for software development.&nbsp; The object oriented paradigm is another
popular
method in use today. </p>
<p>Errors can occur at any phase of software development.&nbsp; Any of
these
errors can lead to serious problems and result in software that does
not
function as desired.&nbsp; Given the disastrous results with the
software in the X-ray machine, we must take every precaution possible
to be sure there
are no errors in our systems.&nbsp; Several things have been done. </p>
<p>"Formal languages" have been developed in which requirements can be
expressed
instead of expressing them in ambiguous and imprecise English.&nbsp;
The
design can be reviewed by a team of professionals for potential
problems.&nbsp; Prototypes can be used to clarify requirements or
difficult design algorithms.&nbsp; An appropriate high-level language
choice will reduce errors.&nbsp; Code walkthroughs
help the developer locate many errors.&nbsp; A code walkthrough is a
line-by-line
reading of a unit of code by a team of professionals.&nbsp; The purpose
of
each line in the given program is explained.&nbsp; Good documentation
habits
and good naming conventions decrease errors too.&nbsp; A good design
and
a good programmer are the best way to avoid coding errors. </p>

<p>Finally, careful testing must be done before software is released.&nbsp; <b>Testing</b> is the process of locating errors
and <b>debugging</b> is the process of localizing, analyzing, and
removing
suspected errors in the code. </p>
<p>If an instruction is written incorrectly it is called a <b>syntax
error</b> and will be caught by the compiler.&nbsp; If a
formula or algorithm is incorrectly implemented, it is called a <b>logic error</b> and
should be caught by the programmer or tester.&nbsp; Errors that manifest themselves 
at run time are called <b>run time
errors</b> (i.e., dividing by zero or array index out of range).<!-- Blank Space --> <br>

<h3> <a name="B"></a>B. Debugging Techniques</h3>
</center>
<p>A theory of debugging was developed by Poston that is based on <b>Most
Probable Errors (MPEs)</b>.&nbsp; MPEs are the most frequent mistakes
made by programmers.&nbsp; The most likely place to contain an error is
in an IF
- THEN - ELSE conditional expression. The second most likely place for
errors
is in input/output statements and the third is in loops.&nbsp;

According to
this theory, you should check the conditional expression in any If
statement first.&nbsp; Then I/O statements should be checked and
finally loops should be examined. </p>
<p>How does one localize and analyze an error? There are standard
debugging techniques that can be used.&nbsp; You will practice these in
this lab.&nbsp; They are as follows: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Get a hard copy of your program.<br>
Read the code and think about what it does. (Desk check)</li>

  <li> Use print statements to pinpoint the source of an error.</li>
  <li> Use a debugger to help locate an error.</li>
</ol>
<p>A program is written only once but is read many times.&nbsp; Donald
Knuth has developed a system, called <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/%7Eknuth/cweb.html">CWEB</a>
,
that helps one develop software as a work of literature.&nbsp;
Explaining
CWEB is beyond the scope of this lab exercise but we must learn <i>to
read
our programs for debugging purposes</i> and <i>write programs that are
readable</i>.&nbsp;

If we read our code to ourselves we often read over our errors.&nbsp;
It
is a good idea to read our code to another knowledgeable person
explaining
how each line contributes to the solution. </p>
<hr>
<p>When reading through program code, often just looking at the code  does not help us identify the 
logic error(s).  To help us locate logic errors, we can insert
output (<b>cout &lt;&lt;</b>) statements at strategic places in the
code to
localize errors.&nbsp; These output statements allow us to trace the
path
of execution or to trace the value of certain variables as the program
is
executed to determine what part of the code is not functioning
correctly.&nbsp; There are 3 types of traces that can be implemented by
placing output statements in the code - subprogram trace, statement
trace, and variable trace.&nbsp; A <b>subprogram trace</b> is used to
determine the order in which subprograms are called.&nbsp; An output
statement that outputs the name of the subprogram is placed at the
start of every subprogram to implement a subprogram trace.&nbsp; A <b>statement
level trace</b> is used to determine where the execution of
the program halts.&nbsp; An output statement can be placed after
different statements in the code to determine which instructions are
executed before the program halts. </p>

<p>If an answer produced by the program is wrong, we look at variables
used
to calculate this answer.&nbsp; To implement a <b>variable trace</b>,
we
print the value of variables involved in the calculation at different
places
to see where one or more of them became incorrect. When a variable of
interest
is changed, the new value should be printed with the name of the
enclosing
block and a line number to help identify where the change
occurred.&nbsp;
All input to the program as well as input to all subprograms should be
checked
to make sure the values are valid. </p>
<p>Once we locate and fix the problem, the output statements are no
longer needed.&nbsp; They can be removed with the editor and the code
recompiled. In some languages such as "C++" there is a mechanism by
which the output statements
can physically be left in the source code but directions can be given
to
the compiler to omit them when the last compile is done.&nbsp; If the
statements
are needed later they do not have to be retyped.

<hr> <a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise1')"><font color="#bb2222"><b>Exercise
1:</b></font></a> 

<font color="#bb2222">
One type of testing is called black box testing. In this scenario, 
the tester does not test by examining the source code, 
but tests based upon the requirements of the program, the input, and the expected 
output. <b>Black box testing</b> focuses on 
functionality, or what the system should do. One type of black box testing is <b>
input partitioning</b> or equivalence partitioning. Information about the input 
is used to divide the input domain into valid and invalid groups of input 
values.

<p>Let's consider a program which reads a list of integers and 
outputs <b>YES</b> if the list is in strictly descending order and it contains
at least one but no more than 10 integers.  The program outputs <b>NO</b>, 
otherwise. You, as the software test engineer, need to create test cases and test the program
thoroughly to make sure it correctly handles all kinds of inputs.

<h4>Program Specifications</h4>
<p>Let's consider the program noted in Exercise 1 which reads a list of integers and 
outputs <b>YES</b> if the list is in strictly descending order and it contains
at least one but no more than 10 integers.  The program outputs <b>NO</b>, 
otherwise. The program as given in Exercise 2 below makes use of command line
arguments to input the list of integers. For example, if the executable program name is a.out, then the command
<blockquote><b> a.out 7 6 4 1  </b></blockquote>
would execute the program and provide as input to the program the 
four numbers 7, 6, 4, and 1 and IF it is correctly executing, then it should also 
produce the output YES.
If you are unfamiliar with command line arguments and need additional information after looking at the 
program code referenced in 
Exercise 2 below, then see

The source code found in Exercise 2 is suppose to work 
according the program specifications noted above for which input comes from the command line. 
Similar to Exercise 1, we wish to identify errors in the program via testing, 
but in this exercise we will have the source code available.

<h3> <a name="C"></a>C. Using NetBeans -- Integrated
Development
Environment (IDE)</h3>
</center>
<p>NetBeans is an integrated developement environment that
allows a developer to edit, compile/build, debug, and run projects with
components written in multiple languages. It provides simplified code
reuse and has good debugging support. A <i>debugger</i> is a program that controls the
execution of another program for the purpose of locating (and/or
repairing) errors.<br>
</p>
<p> NetBeans documentation beyond what is found in this lab can be found at
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/kb/index.html">http://www.netbeans.org/kb/index.html</a>
</p>
<p> In this lab, we will learn to develop a project written in C++
using NetBeans. In particular, we will learn to use the
built-in debugger. With the debugger, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li> set a <b>breakpoint</b> to halt execution at a certain line or
function</li>
  <li><b>display </b>values of variables and expressions</li>
  <li><b>step</b> through the code one instruction at a time</li>

  <li><b>run</b> the program from the start or <b>continue</b> after a
break in the execution</li>
  <li>do a <b>backtrace</b> to see who has called whom to get to where
you are</li>
  <li><b>quit</b> debugging.. <br>

  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>To practice using the NetBeans debugger, we must first
create a new C++ project in NetBeans<br>
</b></p>
<p>Start by logging into <i>ranger</i> using an NX client. See the previous lab if you
need to review this process.
</p><p>Next from the command window, enter/type <b>"netbeans&amp;"</b> </p>
<p>A window similar to the following should appear
