<h3>
<a NAME="A"></a>A. Introduction</h3></center>
<p>A <a href="javascript:Display('../labA/labA.html')">previous lab</a> dealt
with debugging, the process of "localizing, analyzing, and removing" errors
in a program. In this lab, we will again examine errors, but we will examine
them from a different perspective. We will not be concerned with removing
errors but with attempting to show that errors exist. <i>Software Testing</i>
is the process of showing that there are errors in a software system. But,
as Professor Edsger Dijkstra says, "Testing can never show the absence of
errors, only that there are errors. Software testing should span the entire
life-cycle of a software system from analysis through maintenance." The
focus in this lab will be on the formal testing methods that are used after
implementation to show that the system has errors (bugs).
<p>Testing is a critical part of quality software development. Inadequate
testing embarrassed NASA when the Hubble Space Telescope and Mars Observer
failed to operate properly. Unfortunately, examples of poor testing are
abundant.
<p>There are several reasons for inadequate testing but NO EXCUSES.
Often by the time the software is running, the project is so far behind
schedule that there is little time for testing. Additionally, it is often
the developer (programmer) who does the testing. No one wants to find errors
in his or her own work. Besides, the programmer knows it works since he
or she wrote it. Companies like Microsoft and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
have separate independent <i>test groups</i>. The job of a group of testers
is to show that software has errors. If they don't find errors, they fail.
This attitude characterizes a good tester but this attitude is rarely found
in a programmer testing his or her own code.
<p>In the testing phase, there are several levels of testing: unit
testing, subsystem testing, system testing, regression testing. We will
emphasize unit testing in this lab.

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<!-- PART B -->
<center>
<h3>
<a NAME="B"></a>B. Unit Testing: Structural Testing</h3></center>
<p><b>Unit testing</b> (testing one function or procedure) is at the lowest
level of the testing phase. Unit testing is usually done by the programmer
who wrote the unit or module and makes use of the structure of the code.
For example, consider the following example:
<pre>
        if (grossPay &lt; 30000.00)
           action 1;
        else
           action 2;
</pre>

<p>To test this statement, the tester would input test data for grossPay less
than 30000 and other test data for grossPay greater than 30000 and the
boundary case grossPay = 30000. Because the tester can see the internal
structure, such testing is called <b>structural testing</b>. It is also
referred to as <b>white-box</b> (or <b>glass-box</b>) testing since the
tester can see inside the unit (i.e., see the code). There are three types
of structural or glass box testing: <b>statement</b>, <b>branch</b>, and
<b>path coverage</b>.

<p>In <b>statement coverage</b>, test cases are input that cause the execution
of each statement in the unit. If some statement is not executed during
testing, its reliability must be suspect. <b>Branch testing</b> is implemented
by running test cases that exercise each branch of an "if" statement. Branch
coverage is a stronger testing technique than statement coverage. In a
procedure with one entry and one exit, branch coverage guarantees statement
coverage.

<p><b>Path testing</b> insures that all paths through the code are executed.
A path is a list of instructions necessary to go from the entry to the
exit statement in the unit. The main disadvantage of path testing is that
a unit that contains loops may have an "infinite" number of paths. For
example, once through the loop and out or twice through the loop and out,
etc.

NOTE: For each of the following exercises, indicate answers on the 
<a href="javascript:AnswerWindow('labD/labD')">answer sheet.</a></h5>

<!-- EXERCISE 1 -->
<h5>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise1')">Exercise 1</a> : We want to decide
what tests to run to test the following function using path coverage. In
this example, branch and path testing are the same. First we should list
the paths through this function. One path, for someone who had an ACT of
17, for example would be:
<p>lines 1-2-8
<p>List the other two paths through the function on your answer sheet.</h5>
<a NAME="function"></a>
<pre>
//Calculate and return the appropriate csci course to recommend
//based on a student's ACT and math background. An ACT of less
//than 18 or lack of Algebra II keeps a student from taking a csci
//course and 0 is returned.

int csci(int act,           // Student ACT score
         int math)          // HS Math: 0 = noAlg, 1 = algl, 2 = alg2
                            // Return csci course to take
{
     int take;

     if ((act &lt; 18) &amp;&amp; (0 &lt; act))                   //line 1
          take = 9;                                 //line 2
     else                                           //line 3
          if (math &lt; alg2)                          //line 4
               take = 0;                            //line 5
          else                                      //line 6
               take = 117;                          //line 7

     return take;                                   //line 8
}
</pre>

<!-- EXERCISE 2 -->
<h5>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise2')">Exercise 2</a> : Now determine
values of ACT and math that would cause each of the 3 paths to be executed
once. Fill in test case input and the expected "output" resulting from
the input in the table on the answer sheet.</h5>

<!-- Blank Space -->
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p>Look at the previous <a href="#function">csci( ) function</a> and note that the input data
ACT = 12 and math = 2 causes the execution of one PATH in the function
(lines 1,2, and 8). The number of paths through a unit is determined by
the control statements such as "if', "while", "do", "switch", and so on.
To test a unit usually requires a test driver program. For example, to
input the test data to the csci() function above would require another
procedure or function (probably a small main program) to call the function
and pass it the different values of the arguments. The output should be
printed for the tester to inspect. The following is a simple test driver
for the csci( ) function:&nbsp;
<a NAME="driver"></a>
<pre>
// testCsci.cc : Test driver for csci function.

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

const int noalg=0;
const int alg1=1;
const int alg2=2;

int csci(...) // code for csci function goes here
{
...
}

int main(void)
{
    int answer;
    // First test case
        cout &lt;&lt; "Test 1: act= " &lt;&lt; 18 &lt;&lt; " math = " &lt;&lt; 2;
        answer = csci(18,2);
        cout &lt;&lt; " csci = " &lt;&lt; answer;

    // Second test case

}
</pre>

<!-- EXERCISE 3 -->
<h5>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise3')">Exercise 3</a> : What is 
the output of the above program?
</h5>

<!-- Blank Space -->
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p>As mentioned in the lab on debugging, many programming errors occur in
conditional expressions. Values at the boundaries of conditionals should
be tested. The boundary value of the conditional ACT &lt; 18 is 18. The
boundary values for the loop "<i>for( i=0; i &lt; NumberStudents; i++)</i>"
are <i>i = 0</i> and <i>i = NumberStudents</i>.

<!-- EXERCISE 4 -->
<h5>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise4')">Exercise 4</a> : In the 
<a href="#function">csci( ) function</a>, give values for 3 boundary tests.
<p>Boundary values may also include very small or very large values for the
inputs. For example, in testing a program that reads a file, you should
try a file with no data in it, a file with one item, and a very large file.

<!-- PART C -->
<center>
<h3>
<a NAME="C"></a>C. Unit Testing: Black Box</h3></center>
<p>Another type of testing is called black box testing. The tester cannot
examine the structure of the code. The requirements of the program, input,
and expected output are used to make the test cases. Black box testing
focuses on functionality, or what the system should do. One type of black
box testing is <b>input partitioning</b> or equivalence partitioning. Information
about the input is used to divide the input domain into valid and invalid
groups of input values. In the <a href="#function">csci( ) function</a>, 
we could divide the <b>ACT</b> input values into: less than 0, the value 0, between 0 and 18, 
the value 18, and greater than 18. We could divide the <b>math</b> input values into:
less than 0, 0, 1, 2, and greater than 2.

<p><b>InlabD</b> is a run-unit which is designed to calculate and
print the two roots of a quadratic equation of the form
<p>a x<sup>2</sup> + b x + c = 0
<br><br>where a, b, and c are integers. The program will prompt for the
values for a, b, and c. As you remember from mathematics, a formula called
the quadratic equation calculates the two roots, if a is not 0:
<dir>x1 = (-b + sqrt(b<sup>2</sup> - 4*a*c))/(2*a)
<br>x2 = (-b - sqrt(b<sup>2</sup> - 4*a*c))/(2*a)</dir>

<p>Let's test this run-unit using black-box techniques, but first think about
values of a, b, and c that should be valid and invalid and values that
yield different types of roots: repeated real, distinct real, and non-real(complex).

<!-- EXERCISE 5 -->
<h5>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise5')">Exercise 5</a>: Copy inlabD to
your account and run this run-unit by typing
&nbsp;
<dir><i>ranger%</i> inlabD</dir>
Please note that you are not given the source code so do not attempt to
display this file on the screen. Enter values for a, b, and c during the
run.<b>WARNING:</b>Input small values for a, b, and c so that you will be able to determine what the correct output should be!</h5>

<!-- EXERCISE 6 -->
<h5>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise6')">Exercise 6</a>: Use input partitioning
to design 4 test cases. You are to choose valid and invalid values of a,
b, and c. Be sure to use small values for a, b, and c.  Write your choices in the table on the answer sheet. Predict
what the values of x1 and x2 will be and then fill in the "Expected Results".
If you give values of a, b, and c that cause a runtime error you should
write that under "Error Messages." The rest of the table will be filled
in in Exercise 7.</h5>

<!-- EXERCISE 7 -->
<h5>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise6')">Exercise 7</a>: Run the program
using the above test data and place the actual results in the table from
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise6')">Exercise
6</a>. Turn in a script file of your testing.</h5>

<!-- Blank Space -->
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p>When testing uncovers an error, someone, usually the programmer, must debug
the software. Then, the system must be tested again. Research has shown
that correcting an error introduces additional errors into the program
20-40% of the time. That is, while fixing one error we create another error
(or perhaps we don't fix the one already identified). Testing is never
finished. Test drivers and test data should be kept so they can be rerun
after debugging. This type of testing is called <b>regression testing</b>.

<p>Imagine you wrote the software for an X-Ray machine that would administer
radiation treatment to you. When would you stop testing? If a company tests
too long, its competitors could announce a similar product and capture
the market (you could lose your job). Determining how much testing is enough
is a difficult task. Currently, much research is being conducted in this
area of computing which is called <b>software reliability</b>.

<!-- EXERCISE 8 -->
<h5>
<a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise8')">Exercise 8</a>: In the last part
of this lab on testing, you should gain experience in testing a unit (actually
a function). Copy the source file <a href="javascript:Display('$CLA/inlabDb.cc')">inlabDb.cc</a>
to your account and after studying the code for the function which it contains,
decide on the tests that should be run to adequately test 5 paths in the
given function. Place your choices for test data and your expected results
in the table in the answer sheet. Run the program using the test data chosen
and record the actual results in the table. Turn in a script file containing
the source file and the results from your test runs. If your actual results
are different from the expected results then you found errors
in the code.</h5>
