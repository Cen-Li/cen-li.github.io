<p>In this lab session we will study a data structure called a queue. This 
structure has many applications in computing such as holding files awaiting 
printer access.<blockquote>A.&nbsp; <a href="#A">Definition of Queue</a>

<h3>
<a NAME="A"></a>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of Queue</h3></center>
</blockquote>
<p>A <b>queue</b> is an abstract data type in which insertion occurs at one end (the rear) 
and deletion occurs at the other end (the front). A queue is defined to hold one 
type of data element. Only the elements indicated by front and rear can be 
accessed. Thus a queue is a restricted access data structure similar to the 
stack. Like a stack, the elements are related to each other by the order in 
which they are placed on the queue. <br>

<p>An example of a queue is a line of people waiting at a ticket counter to buy a 
ticket. Whoever gets in line first gets a ticket first. A queue is a <b>First In, 
First Out (FIFO) </b>data storage mechanism. The storage structure that holds jobs 
for printing on a printer is typically a queue. When an operating system (OS) 
runs in batch mode (i.e. non-interactive), jobs to be processed are usually 
placed in a queue awaiting execution. However, sometimes the OS gives priority 
to smaller jobs in the queue, and if so, it becomes a &quot;priority queue.&quot; </p>
<p><b>Insertion</b> and <b>deletion</b> operations have special names in queues - insertion is 
called <b>enqueue</b> and deletion is called <b>dequeue</b>. A queue often serves as a 
&quot;waiting line.&quot; Items put onto the queue (enqueued) come off (dequeued) in the 
same order. A queue, like a cafeteria line, has a <b>front</b> and a <b>rear</b>. Items are 
inserted at the rear of the queue and removed from the front of the queue.</p>

<hr>
We define a queue using a <b>Queue</b> class. As in the case of a stack, there 
are several ways to implement the <b>Queue</b> class. We will illustrate two both array 
and pointer implementations and discuss the merits of each. <br><b>
<!-- PART B -->
<p align="center">
<a NAME="B"></a><font size="4">B.&nbsp; Array 
Implementation of a Queue</font></b> </p>
<P>First we demonstrate how the data in a Queue class can be implemented with an 
array, say elements[0..n-1], a counter nbrElts, and a pair of array indexes, 
frontIndx and rearIndx. The array could hold any type of data, even a record or 
a class type. In an array implementation of a queue <b>nbrElts = 0</b> will mean the 
queue is empty. The data members <b>nbrElts</b>, <b>frontIndx</b> and <b>rearIndx</b> would each be 
initialized to <b>0</b> by a class constructor. To enqueue an element we store the new 
element at position rearIndx in the array and increment rearIndx unless the 
array is full. Thus code in the enqueue method might appear as:<blockquote>
	<P><b><font size="2">//enqueue:<br>if (! full())&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //full checks for nbrElts = n<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elements[rearIndx] = newElement;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rearIndx++;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nbrElts++;<br>}</font></b>
</blockquote>
<p>To dequeue an element we must first determine if the queue is empty. If the 
queue is not empty, we save the item at frontIndx and then increment frontIndx. 
Finally, we return the saved item to the calling function. The code in the 
dequeue method might appear as follows: 
<blockquote>
	<p><b><font size="2">//dequeue: <br>if (!empty())&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //empty checks for nbrElts = 0<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frontElt = elements[frontIndx];<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frontIndx++;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nbrElts--;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return frontElt;<br>}</font></b></blockquote>


<p>
<!-- EXERCISE 2 -->
<hr>
<b><a href="javascript:Answer('Exercise2')"><font color="BB2222">Exercise 2:</font></a></b><font color="BB2222">
Suppose q is an instance of the Queue class and assume that the previous 
array implementation is used. Also, assume that the size of the array is 5, and 
that it is initially empty. Show <b>q</b> (<b>nbrElts</b>,<b> frontIndx</b>, <b>rearIndx</b> and contents of 
the array <b>elements</b>) after all of the following operations have been completed.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
q.enqueue(39);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
q.enqueue(22);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
item1 = q.dequeue();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
q.enqueue(59);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
item2 = q.dequeue();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
item3 = q.dequeue();</font></a><hr>
<p>As you can see, each enqueue operation 
advances rearIndx and nothing ever decreases it. Matters get worse as the queue 
is used. For instance, suppose n elements are enqueued and all are dequeued. We 
will have frontIndx = n , rearIndx = n and nbrElts = 0. Since nbrElts = 0 says 
the queue is empty, we could try to store something at elements[rearIndx] (that 
is elements[n]) but this slot does not exist in an array indexed from 0 to 
MAX_QUEUE_SIZE-1. 
To avoid this problem, we could copy each element in the queue to the next lower 
position each time a dequeue occurs, but this has a high cost of data movement 
and is not practical. We need a better solution. 
<!-- PART C ------>
<p align="center"><a NAME="C"></a>
<b><font size="4">C. &quot;Circular&quot; Array implementation of a Queue<p>
</font></b>We can think of the array of elements as a circular list by &quot;gluing&quot; the end of 
the array elements[0..MAX_QUEUE_SIZE-1] to its front as in the following picture. 
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="lab13C.gif" width="350" height="350"><p>
&nbsp;<p>
In this situation, the queue indexes front and rear advance by moving them 
clockwise around the array. To achieve this, addition modulo n is used in the 
enqueue and dequeue operations described above. Thus, when <b>rearIndx = 
MAX_QUEUE_SIZE - 1</b>, the 
last position in the array, rearIndx is incremented by 1 as follows: <p>
<b>rearIndx = (rearIndx + 1) % n = (MAX_QUEUE_SIZE - 1 + 1 ) % MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 
MAX_QUEUE_SIZE % MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 0</b><p>
A similar formula is used for frontIndx when dequeueing. The new enqueue and 
dequeue algorithms are as follows: <p>
<b><font size="2">//(Circular array) enqueue:<br>
if (! full()) //full checks for nbrElts = MAX_QUEUE_SIZE<br>
{<br>
elements[rearIndx] = newElement;<br>
rearIndx = (rearIndx + 1) % MAX_QUEUE_SIZE<br>
nbrElts++;  // update the number of elements<br>
}<br>
<br>
<br>
//(Circular array) dequeue:<br>
if (!empty()) //empty checks for nbrElts = 0<br>
{<br>
frontElt = elements[frontIndx];<br>
frontIndx = (frontIndx + 1) % MAX_QUEUE_SIZE<br>
nbrElts--;  // update the number of elements<br>
return frontElt;<br>
}</font></b>

Suppose n=4, and you have a circular queue defined as above. Show 
the array elements, the value of frontIndx, the value of rearIndx, the value 
of nbrElts, and the value of item variable after all of the following operations have been completed: </font>

<b><font size="4">&nbsp;D. Linked List Implementation of a Queue </font></b>
</p>


<p align="left">Using a circular array implementation is physically limiting. As 
was the case in a stack, it is sometimes difficult to determine the maximum 
number of elements which a queue may need to contain. Thus we now consider the 
linked list implementation of a queue. Assume that frontPtr and rearPtr are 
pointers to the front and rear nodes in a linked representation of a queue. The 
queue can now be visualized as in the following picture: </p>
<center><img border="0" src="linkedlist.gif" width="600" height="157"></center>
<p align="left">Enqueueing means inserting a new node at the &quot;end&quot; of the list 
(where rearPtr points) and making rearPtr point at this new node, while 
dequeueing means deleting the node pointed to by frontPtr and resetting frontPtr. 
Both operations are straightforward. Here is the algorithm for the enqueue: </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><b><font size="2">//(linked list) 
enqueue:<br>
Make p point at a new node<br>
Copy new data into node p<br>
Set p's pointer field to NULL<br>
Set the link in the rear node to point to p<br>
Set rearPtr = p</font></b></p>
