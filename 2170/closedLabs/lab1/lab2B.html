Lab 1 -- cin, cout, and formatted output

<p>
In this lab, you will write a C++ program using the . 
Follow the steps to start your program:
<ol>
<li> Change directory into the "CLA" directory:  <font color=red> $ cd CLA</font>
<li> Create a new directory named "CLA2" under the CLA directory :<font color=red> $ mkdir CLA2</font>
<li> Create the program using the vi editor: <font color=red>$ vi conversion.cpp</font>
</ol>
 
<h2>The programming problem</h2>
Write a C++ program (named "conversion.cpp")
 that converts the US dollar amount into Euro. The program first prompts the user to enter the amount of US dollars to be converted, then calculates the equivalent amount in Euro, and finally display the result. All the money amount should be displayed with 2 digits after the decimal point.

<font color=blue>The conversion rate should be created as a constant.</a></font>

Once you finished writing your program, compile and run the program with these commands:
<ol>
<li>Compile the program: <font color=red>$ c++ conversion.cpp -o run2</font>
<li>Run the program: <font color=red>$ run2</font>
</ol>

<br><P>
Here is an example run of the program:

<hr>
<xmp>
Enter amount of US Dollar you want to convert : $ 580.50
You entered $580.50

1 dollar = 0.87 EUR 
580.50 US Dollar is equivalent to 505.04 EUR
</xmp>
<hr>

<h2>
How to display float value with specific precision</h2>
To display the float values with desired precision, i.e., 2 digits after the decimal point, 
add the following two statements in your program:
<ul>
<li>Add:
<xmp>#include <iomanip></xmp> in the preprocessor directive section of the program, i.e., at the very top of the program. iomanip is the C++ header file that defines the input and output manipulators.
<li> Add the statement:
<xmp>cout << fixed << setprecision(2); </xmp>
before the cout statement that displays the float value.
The value 2 indicates that two digits after the decimal is to be printed.
</ul>

<h2>Steps to edit, compile, run, and submit the program:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If after you compile your program, there is compilation errors, then you need to modify the program according to the error messages. 
You may need to edit and compile your program multiple times before it compiles successfully.

<li>Now you can run the program, check to make sure the output is correct. If not, you need to modify the program and recompile and rerun the program.

<li>Once you are able to successfully run the program with the correct outputs, you are ready to submit the program electronically. 

Following the steps below to create the script file :
<xmp>
script log2
pr -n -t -e4 conversion.cpp
c++ conversion.cpp -o lab2run
lab2run
exit
</xmp>
This create the script file named log2.

<li>
Submit the program with the "handin" command shown below:
<br>
<font color=red>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp handin lab2 conversion.cpp log2
</font>
<br>
(<b>Note: the name of the program needs to match the required file name exactly for submission to be successful.</b>)
<!--
All the programs will be submitted using D2L Dropbox. 
Log into D2L web site, click on the course title "Computer Science II", find the Dropbox named "Closed Lab 2", and upload the file "main.cpp" from the directory "~/codelite/cla2/".
