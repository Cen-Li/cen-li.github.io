Lab 1 -- cin, cout, and formatted output

<p>
In this lab, you will write a C++ program using Replit. 
 
<h2>The programming problem</h2>
Write a C++ program 
 that converts the US dollar amount into Euro. The program first prompts the user to enter the amount of US dollars to be converted, then calculates the equivalent amount in Euro, and finally display the result. All the money amount should be displayed with 2 digits after the decimal point.

<font color=blue>The conversion rate should be created as a constant.</a></font>

Once you finished writing your program, compile and run the program with these commands:

<br><P>
Here is an example run of the program:

<hr>
<xmp>
Enter amount of US Dollar you want to convert : $ 580.50
You entered $580.50

1 dollar = 0.87 EUR 
580.50 US Dollar is equivalent to 505.04 EUR
</xmp>
<hr>

<h2>
How to display float value with specific precision</h2>
To display the float values with desired precision, i.e., 2 digits after the decimal point, 
add the following two statements in your program:
<ul>
<li>Add:
<xmp>#include <iomanip></xmp> in the preprocessor directive section of the program, i.e., at the very top of the program. iomanip is the C++ header file that defines the input and output manipulators.
<li> Add the statement:
<xmp>cout << fixed << setprecision(2); </xmp>
before the cout statement that displays the float value.
The value 2 indicates that two digits after the decimal is to be printed.
</ul>

<h2>Submit the program:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If after you compile your program, there is compilation errors, then you need to modify the program according to the error messages. 
You may need to edit and compile your program multiple times before it compiles successfully.

<li>Now you can run the program, check to make sure the output is correct. If not, you need to modify the program and recompile and rerun the program.

<li>Once you are able to successfully run the program with the correct outputs, you are ready to submit the program.
Submit the source program only.
