      </center>


Write a C++ program named <font color=blue>statistics.cpp</font> that computes the various statistics: average, largest, and smallest values based on the values read from a data file.
<p>
Copy the datafiles (lab7-1.dat and lab7-2.dat) into your lab 7 directory.
<p>
<h2>Program Requirement:</h2>
<p>
You need to write 2 user defined functions (in addition to the main function) for this program:
Develop each function one by one. That is to write one function, 
compile and run the program with that function. 
If successful, move on to add the 2nd function, compile and run that program. 
Do not try to implement all the functions at once.</font></a>
<ol>
<li>Prompt the user for the file name. Open the data file specified by the user.
<li> Write a user defined function named "ComputeStatistics". This function is responsbile for:
    <ul>
    <li>Read data one by one from the data file (<font color=red>remember: file streams are always passed to function as reference parameters</font>)
    <li>Display the values as they are read in,
    <li>Count the number of values read,
    <li>Compute the statistics: smallest, largest, and average,
    <li>Return all the information (count and all the statistics) back to the calling function through reference parameters.
    <li><font color=red>Question: Should the parameters corresponding to the "count", "smallest", "largest", and "average" be passed as value parameters or reference parameters?</font>
    </ul>
<li> Write a function named "DisplayResults". This function is responsible for:
    <ul>
    <li>Display the results as shown in the example program runs
    <li><font color=red>Question: Should the parameters to this function be value parameters or reference parameters?</font>
    </ul>
</ol>    
When you write the functions, think: 
    <ul>
    <li> What should be the type of this function? void or value returning?
    <li> What are the parameters of this function?
    <li> Should each parameter be passed by value? or by reference?
    </ul>
