Lab 17 -- Sorted List Class with <em>Struct Type Data</em> 
      </h1>
      </center>

In this lab, we practice using the <em>sorted list class</em> to work with struct type data.
Follow the steps shown below to develop your project:
<ol>
<li>Create a new directory for this project. Copy the code provided into this directory.
Copy the data file into this directory.<p>
<p>

Add the following struct type definition for BookType to slist.h file.
<br>
In addition, make "ItemType" an alias of the type "BookType".
<li>
<xmp>
#ifndef SortedList_H
#define SortedList_H

struct BookType
{
    string title;
    string author;
    int publicationYear;

    bool operator < (const BookType & rhs) {
        return (title < rhs.title);
    }
    bool operator != (const BookType & rhs) {
        return (title != rhs.title);
    }
    bool operator > (const BookType & rhs) {
        return (title > rhs.title);
    }
};

const int MAX_LENGTH=50;
typedef BookType ItemType;       // <-- this line sets the item type of this list to be of type "BookType"

class SortedList 
{
   ....

};
#endif

</xmp>
<p>

Write the client program to read the book records from the data file one record at a time. 
Once the values of one book is read, insert it into the list of books.
Repeat this until the end of the data file is reached or the capacity of the list is reached.
<br>Hint: This is the same data file we discussed in this example:
<a href=../../private/code/review/31-struct-sort.cpp target=new>link to program code</a>. 
<p>
<br>
<xmp>
int size=0;
BookType aBook;
while (size < MAX_SIZE && getline(myIn, aBook.title)) {

		getline(myIn, aBook.author);

		myIn >> aBook.publicationYear;
		myIn.ignore(100, '\n');

		// You are required add code below 
                // to add the book into the list and update "size"


}
</xmp>
<p>

<li>After the list of books is built, display the books one by one as shown below.
<p>
<li>Prompt the user to enter the name of an author, display only the books written by this author.
<br>Here is the program logic for the client program:
<xmp>
// First, add code here to "reset" the iterator for the list object

// Then, apply a "for" loop to go through the entire list item by item:
{
   // First, retrieve the next item

   // Then, check to see if this item has the author name matches with the author name entered by the user

         // If the name matches, display the information about the book 

}
</xmp>
</ol>

<h2>Makefile</h2>

<p>
<p>
Create the makefile as this:
<xmp>
## Create the executable file 
lab17Run:slist.o main.o
        $(CC) slist.o main.o -o lab17Run

## Create the object files 
slist.o:slist.cpp
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c slist.cpp

main.o:main.cpp
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.cpp

clean:
        rm *.o
</xmp>
To compile the program, simply type "make" at the prompt. This will create the executable file
named lab17Run. Execute the program by typing "lab17Run".
<p>
<h2>What to Submit?</h2>
For this lab, you need to submit these files: <b>slist.h, slist.cpp, main.cpp, and makefile </b>
