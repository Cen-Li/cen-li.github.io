Lab 4 -- Programming C++ using while Statements
      </h1>
      </center>

<p>
In this lab, you will write two C++ programs to solve two problems. Two seperate projects need to be created, one for each problem. Create the second project after you have finished programming for the first problem.
<p>

<h2>Programming Problem One</h2>
Write a C++ program, named <b>"average.cpp"</b>, that reads all the values from a data file, display the values and computes the average of these values.

<h3>Important!</h3>
You may download the data file from the course page. In order for the data file to be accessible by the project, the data file needs to be placed in the "Debug" directory in the project directory.

Using the terminal approach:
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal
<li>Navigate to the "Debug" directory under the current project directory using the "cd" command ("cd" stands for "change directory").
<li>Type the following command:   cp ~cen/data/lab4.data . <br>
This command copies the data file into your currect directory.
</ol>
<p>
Here is an example run of the program:

<p> Sample run 1
<xmp>
The values read are:
30
40
25
64
89
103
45
89
34
24
15
63

Total 12 numbers. The average of these values is 51.75.

</xmp>
<hr>

<h2>Programming Problem two</h2>

Write a C++ program named <b>"coin.cpp"</b>
that simulates flipping a coin repeatedly and continues until
three consecutive heads are tossed. At that point, your program should display the total
number of coin flips that were made. Use rand() function to simulate random toss of the coin.
Here are a few example runs of the program:

<p> Sample run 1
<xmp>
Head
Tail
Tail
Head
Head
Tail
Head
Tail
Head
Head
Head
It took 11 flips to get 3 consecutive heads.
</xmp>
<hr>

<p> Sample run 2
<xmp> 
Tail
Head
Tail
Tail
Tail
Tail
Head
Head
Tail
Head
Tail
ead
Head
Tail
Tail
Head
Head
Head
It took 18 flips to get 3 consecutive heads.
</xmp>
<hr>

<p>
For this lab, you need to submit two files: average.cpp and coin.cpp.
<p>
<h2>Steps to edit, compile, run, and submit the program:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If after you compile your program, there is compilation errors, then you need to modify the program according to the error messages. 
You may need to edit and compile your program multiple times before it compiles successfully.

<li>Now you can run the program, check to make sure the output is correct. If not, you need to modify the program and recompile and rerun the program.

<li>Once you are able to successfully run the program with the correct outputs, you are ready to submit the program electronically. Only submit the source file. 

Locate the source file in your "project" directory under your "workspace" directory. 
For example, if you named your "workspace" as "codelite" under your home directory, and named the project "cla4", then "inorder.cpp" should be in ~/codelite/cla4 directory.
