Lab 8 -- Programming C++ with <b>One Dimensional Array</b>
      </h1>
      </center>

<p>
In this lab, we will practice simple operations with one dimensional array.

<h2>Program Description</h2>

Write a C++ program named <b>"frequency.cpp"</b>.
In the program, your program reads in a line of text. It counts the number of appearance of individual characters appearing in the line of text entered, and displays the counts.

<h1>What to submit?</h1>
<p>
For this lab, you need to submit: <b>frequency.cpp</b>.
<p>
<h2>Steps to edit, compile, run, and submit the program:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If after you compile your program, there is compilation errors, then you need to modify the program according to the error messages. 
You may need to edit and compile your program multiple times before it compiles successfully.

<li>Now you can run the program, check to make sure the output is correct. If not, you need to modify the program and recompile and rerun the program.

<li>Once you are able to successfully run the program with the correct outputs, you are ready to submit the program electronically. Only submit the source file. 

Locate the source file in your "project" directory under your "workspae" directory. 
For example, if you named your "workspace" as "codelite" under your home directory, and named the project "cla8", then "frequency.cpp" should be in ~/codelite/cla8 directory.
