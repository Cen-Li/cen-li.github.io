1)If int1 has the value 12, int2 has the value 18, and int3 has the value 21, what is the result of each of the following Boolean expressions?

(a)  int1 < int2 && int2 < int3

(b)  int2 <= int1 + 5 || int3 >= int2 + 5

(c)  !(int2 == int1 && int3 == int1)

(d)  !(int1 > 25) && !(int2 < 17)


2. If string1 has the value ?miniscule?, string2 has the value "minimum", and string3 has the value "miniature", what is the result of the following expressions?

(a) string1 > string2 && string2 > string3

(b) string1.substr(0, 4) == string2.substr(0, 4)

(c) string3.length() > string1.length() && string1 > string3

(d) !((string1.substr(8, 1) == string3.substr(8, 1)) && string1.length() == 9)

3. Why won?t the following expression result in a division-by-zero error when variable someInt has the value 0?    

someInt != 0 && 5/someInt > 10


4. Write a Boolean expression that is true when the string variable moon has the value ?blue? or the value ?Blue?


5. Write a Boolean expression that is true when the value of the variable temperature is in the range of 33 to 211 degrees, and the bool variable fahrenheit is true. 


6. Write a Boolean expression that is true when the absolute difference between the value of the variable actualDistance and value of the variable targetDistance is less than 0.001
