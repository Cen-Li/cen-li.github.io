 from fellow students, the lab assistant, and the course instructor.
 It also provides a platform for the students to find study buddies and perform peer supported 
collaborative learning.
</ul>
<p>
<li> <b>Labs</b><p>

 Two types of labs will
be used in this class. They are <b><i>closed lab</i></b> and <b><i>open lab</i></b>.  

<ul>
 <li><b>5(a) Closed Lab</b><p>
<ul>

<li>Lab Graduate Assistant: Ms. Audrey Bolton 
 <ul>
   <li> Email: audreylynnbolton@gmail.com
   <li> Office: KOM 455
   <li> Office phone: 904-8321
   <li>Office Hours:  Wednesday, 4:30-5:30pm
 </ul>
<p>

<li><b>Purpose:</b><p>
Closed labs are
designed to help reinforce lectures or introduce new material.
They give you the opportunity to discuss problems with classmates and ask in depth questions
to the lab assistant.
 Two one-hour lab
periods have been set aside each week in which a closed lab will be completed
under the supervision of the lab assistant. 
Each student turns in the finished closed lab
answer sheet together with program listings when required.
<p>
<li><b>Grading:</b><p> 
Closed labs will be
graded on a 100-point basis. The lab assistant will normally return a closed
lab in a week. If there is any disagreement on scores recorded, you
should be prepared to produce graded labs to document the mistake. Thus it
would be a good idea for you to keep the returned labs in a notebook. If you
disagree with a score received on a lab, see the lab assistant for
clarification of the grading. <p>

If you can not finish
and turn in the lab during the scheduled lab time, you may continue to work on
the lab and turn it in to the lab assistant before 3:00pm on Friday of the same week.
<b> No
labs will be accepted after this time </b> (all labs after this time <b>will</b> <b>receive
a</b> <b>grade of</b> <b>0</b>).  You may turn in the late closed labs to the lab
assistant by leaving it in her mailbox (labeled with <b>Bolton</b>) located in the
Computer Science Department office (KOM 306). Please <b><u>DO NOT</u></b> place them
under her office door, or they will be thrown away (most likely by the person
who shares the office) and counted as a zero.<p>

<li><u>Attendance </u> : University attendance
policies apply. You are required to attend all closed labs. Non-attendance will
result in a zero for the lab unless excused by the lab assistant. If you have
to miss a lab, you must see your lab assistant to obtain permission to turn in
the lab. If permission is granted, you will be expected to make up the lab
before 3pm on Friday of the same week.  <p>

<li><u> Tardiness </u> : Sometimes, the first
10 minutes are spent giving instructions. If you are late, you will need to get
these from a classmate. Most labs take the full time. Therefore, do not be late 
for the labs. <p>

<li><u> Pair Work</u>: You are encouraged to work with a lab partner during all your closed labs.

<li><u> Team Work</u>: There will be closed labs where you are expected to work in a team setting. You are encouraged to actively participate in team project development.
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>5(b) Open labs</b><p>
 Open labs are designed
for solving problems assigned without direct supervision from instructor and lab graduate assistant. You will go to the
lab at your own convenience and solve the assigned problem at your own pace.
You may work on the open labs at either one of the following three lab
locations: KOM 350, 351, 360, or use remote log in from other labs 
on campus, your home or dorm.

<p>
There are multiple ways for you to use the linux system while outside of KOM:
 <ol>

<li> Access the system through the web interface:
  <ul>
<li> First, open a web browser, say Internet 
Explorer, go to web site "www.cs.mtsu.edu". 
<li>Select <b>"NX Session(Ranger)"</b> under <b>"Pages"</b> in the right column.
<li>Click "Connect" on the NX Session image.
<li>Log in using the class account and password.
(When prompted for installation of a NX client, allow installation. The NX gnome window will appear once the installation is completed.It is needed for the first time only.)
</ul>
This allows you to connect to the Ranger system from any computer that has internet connection and a web browser.
<p>

<li> Install the NX client program on your own computer. 
NX client may be downloaded from <a href="http://www.nomachine.com/download.php">No Machine Download</a> page.
<p>

<li> Remote log onto the <u>shemp</u> system, at <u>shemp.cs.mtsu.edu</u>.
Once logged onto the shemp system, you can open and log on to the 
<u>Ranger</u> system by double clicking the "CS Linux Gnome" icon. (Not recommended)

</ol>
<p>

There will be around <b>12</b> open
labs assigned. Each open lab will be graded on a 100-point basis.<p>

Each lab will have an assigned due date.
Due date will be assigned for each open lab. For most open labs, two due dates will be assigned.
If you turn in your program before the first due date, no penalty points will be
deducted, i.e., your lab grade will have a maximum possible grade of 100 points.
 If you turn in your program before the second due date, <b>20</b> points will be 
deducted for late penalty, i.e., your lab grade will have a maximum possible grade of 80 points. 
<b>If you turn in your program after the second due date, your lab score will be 0.</b>
<b>The date will be determined by the time stamp given at the time a program is electronically turned in.
</b>
<p>

You must design, write, implement, and debug your own programs.</b>
Me and the lab assistant are available to help you
in case of problems. 
<!--<b>In order to ask a question about your program, bring a
copy of<i> <u>the latest program</u></i> when you come, including <i><u>any
syntax or run time error messages and outputs</u> </i>generated. </b> <p>
</ul> -->
You are encouraged to ask OLA related questions in <b>PeerSpace</b>(online learning community).
<p>

</ul>
<li><b>Exams:</b><p>
Four in-class 100-point tests plus the final examination will be given during the semester 
<b>No make-up tests will be given. (No Exceptions) </b>
If you miss one of the four tests, the final exam score will be used to
replace this test score. <b>Only one replacement is allowed.</b> 
If no tests was missed, the final exam score replaces the lowest test score. 
The tests will cover materials presented in lectures, assigned readings, homework assignments, open
and closed labs. The final exam will be comprehensive.<p>

The tentative dates for the four tests are:

</center>


<li><b>Academic Honesty</b><p>
<b>All the open lab assignments, tests and final exam are
to be done on an individual basis. </b> 
The penalty for unauthorized collaboration will range from a grade of zero for
an individual assignment to a failing grade for the course. <b><i>The first
offense will result in a grade of zero for the assignment/lab/test/quiz. A
second offense will result in a failing grade for the class.</i></b><p>
See the Computer Science Academic Policy on Academic Integrity at 
<a href="http://www.mtsu.edu/~csdept/Academics/academicIntegrity.htm">http://www.mtsu.edu/~csdept/Academics/academicIntegrity.htm</a>
for a description of unacceptable collaboration.</p>

<!--
<li><b>Assignment Labeling and Submission: </b><p>

To aid the orderly processing of collected homework assignments, the following
guidelines are to be used. All assignments must be turned in on 8
1/2 by 11 inch paper. Use the <i>front</i> of each sheet only. Multiple sheets
must be stapled together. In the upper right-hand corner of
the top sheet: put your name on one line; the course id, section, and
instructor's name on the next; the assignment id on the third; and the due date
on the fourth. For example, your first exercise would have: <p>
Your Name <br>CSCI 1170-01 (Dr. Li)<br>Homework #1<br>Due: mm/dd/yyyy<p>

For all computer assignments, put this information in <b>the upper right-hand corner
of the top page in <i>large</i> characters</b> wherever it will fit without
obscuring something on the page.
-->

<li><b>Attendance</b><p>
Attendance is required
and absences do not excuse one from class responsibilities. If for some
unavoidable reason you must miss class, you should obtain the class notes,
handouts, and assignments from the course web page.You are expected to be
on time for class. Consistent lateness to class is disruptive and is considered
to be disrespectful. 

Class attendance will be taken each day.  
Attendance is determined/judged/counted by the student's initials being written on the daily attendance sheet circulated at the beginning of class.
It is each student's responsibility to locate and sign this sheet each class period (during the class);
</ul>

<li><b>Bonus Points</b><p>
<p>
<img src="../images/bonus.gif" height=50 width=64><br>

<ul>
<li>If you are a member of a group that is one of the top 10 groups in PeerSpace, <font color=red>1 point</font> will be <font color=red>added</font>  to the final course average;
<li>If you one of the top 40 students in PeerSpace, <font color=red>1 point</font> will be <font color=red>added</font>  to the final course average;
<li> If a student misses less than 3 classes
 then <font color=red>1 point</font> will be <font color=red>added</font> to the final course average;
</ul>

<p>
<li><b>Final Course Grade </b><p>
Your grade with be determined as follows:<p>
<table border=2 width=50%>
<tr><th>  <b>Course Work</b> 		</th><th> <b>Percentage</b></th></tr>
<tr><td> Homework</td>			<td align=center> 6% </td></tr>
<tr><td> Open lab assignments </td>	<td align=center> 24% </td></tr>
<tr><td> Closed lab assignments </td>	<td align=center> 10% </td></tr>
<tr><td> Semester exams </td>		<td align=center> 40% </td></tr>
<tr><td> Final exam </td>		<td align=center> 20% </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In addition, [0, 3] points will be
added according to rules specified in Section 9.
<p>
Here is how you can calculate your <b>Final Course Average</b>: <br>
<p>
<b>Homework Average</b> = (Your Total Homework Points)/Total Homework Points Possible * 100 <br>
<b>Test Average</b> = (test 1 + test 2 + test 3 + test 4)/4.0 <br>
<b>Closed Lab Average</b> = (Your Total Closed Lab Points)/Total Closed Lab Points Possible * 100 <br>
<b>Open Lab Average</b> = (Your Total Open Lab Points)/Total Open Lab Points Possible * 100 <br>
<p>
<b>Final Course Average</b> = 
0.06* <b>Homework Average</b> +
0.24 * <b>Open Lab Average</b> + 
0.1 * <b>Closed Lab Average</b> + 
0.4 * <b>Test Average</b> + 
0.2 * <b>Final Exam Score</b>. 
<br>
<p>
Then add/subtract points for <b>attendance</b>.<p>
