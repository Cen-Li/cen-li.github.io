OLA1 part B -- Programming C++ using Conditional Statements
      </h1>
      </center>
<p>
In this lab, you will write two C++ programs using decision statements. <br>
Use the same workspace as the previous closed lab. (Do not create a separate workspace.). <br>
Create two projects in that workspace, one for each problem. 

<p>
Read the instructions on how to change the default source file name from "main.cpp" to a new name:
<ol>
<li>After a new project is created, right click on the file name "main.cpp" in the left panel
<li>Type in the new file name in the prompt window, and 
<li>Click "OK" to remove the original file
</ol>
The new file will be stored in the same directory where the "main.cpp" file was in the file directory.

<h2>Programming Problem One</h2>
Write a C++ program named <font color=red>"student.cpp"</font>. 
This program prompts the user to enter the number of credit hours earned sofar and 
displays his/her corresponding category:
<ul>
<li> Freshman: students with <= 15 credit hours earned
<li> Sophomore: 15 < credit hours earned <= 45
<li> Junior: 45 < credit hours earned <= 75
<li> Senior: 75 < credit hours earned 
</ul>
If the user input is not valid, i.e., credit hours entered < 0, an error message is displayed.
<p>
<font color=red>You are required to use the multi-way decision statement, i.e., the if-else if-else, 
statement for this problem. </font>
<p>
Here are a few example runs of the program:

<p> Sample run 1
<xmp>
Please enter your total credit hours earned: 30
You are a Sophomore.
</xmp>
<hr>

<p> Sample run 2
<xmp>
Please enter your total credit hours earned: 82
You are a Senior.
</xmp>
<hr>

<p> Sample run 3
<xmp>
Please enter your total credit hours earned: 12
You are a Freshman.
</xmp>

<p> Sample run 4
<xmp>
Please enter your total credit hours earned: -10
Invalid input.
</xmp>
<hr>

<h2>Programming Problem Two</h2>
Write a C++ program, named <font color=red>"inorder.cpp"</font>, that reads three integer values from the
user (through keyboard entry), then display the three values in ascending order. For
example, if the user entered 3 values: 84 3 130, the program should output the three
values as: 3, 84, 130.
Here are a few example runs of the program:

<p> Sample run 1
<xmp>
Please enter three integer values: 4 10 6
The three values in ascending order are: 4 6 10
</xmp>
<hr>

<p> Sample run 2
<xmp>
Please enter three integer values: 20 5  3
The three values in ascending order are: 3 5 20
</xmp>
<hr>

<p> Sample run 3
<xmp>
Please enter three integer values: 5 10 20 
The three values in ascending order are: 5 10 20
</xmp>
<hr>

<p> Sample run 4
<xmp>
Please enter three integer values: 20  6  10
The three values in ascending order are: 6 10 20
</xmp>
<hr>

<font color=red>When completing your program, you are encouraged to use the codelite builtin 
debugger to "step through" the program and "monitor" the values of the variables as the program executes.
</font> This can help in finding logic error in the program.
<p>

<h2>What to Submit for this lab:</h2>

For this lab, you need to submit the files:<b>student.cpp</b> and <b>inorder.cpp</b>.

<h2>Steps to edit, compile, run, and submit the program:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If after you compile your program, there is compilation errors, then you need to modify the program according to the error messages. 
You may need to edit and compile your program multiple times before it compiles successfully.

<li>Now you can run the program, check to make sure the output is correct. If not, you need to modify the program and recompile and rerun the program.

<li>Once you are able to successfully run the program with the correct outputs, you are ready to submit the program electronically. 

Locate the source file in your "project" directory under your "workspace" directory. 
For example, if you named your "workspace" as "codelite" under your home directory, and named the project "cla3", then "inorder.cpp" should be in ~/codelite/cla3 directory.

<li>
Submit the program with the "handin" command shown below:
<br>
<font color=red>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp handin lab3A student.cpp
</font>
<br>

Navigate to the second project directory and submit the second program:
<br>
<font color=red>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp handin lab3B inorder.cpp
</font>
<br>

(<b>Note: the name of the program needs to match the required file name exactly for submission to be successful.</b>)
