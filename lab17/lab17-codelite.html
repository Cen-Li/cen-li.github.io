Lab 17 -- Sorted (Array-based) List with <em>Struct Type Data</em> 
      </h1>
      </center>

In this lab, we practice using the <em>array based sorted list class</em> to work with struct type data.
Follow the steps shown below to develop your project:
<ol>
<li>Create a new project "CLA17", <p>
<li>Add to this project a C++ class named "slist" for sorted list. 
Refer to the code discussed in class for this class. <p>
<li>Define the struct type "BookType" in the header file of "slist" 
to store the values of a book record.
<xmp>
#ifndef SortedList_H
#define SortedList_H

struct BookType
{
	string title;
	string author;
	int publicationYear;

	bool operator <= (const BookType & rhs) {   // codelite compiler requires you to put "const" in the parameter when overload the operators
		return (title <= rhs.title);
	}
};

const int MAX_LENGTH=50;
typedef BookType ItemType;       // <-- this line sets the item type of this list to be of type "BookType"
class SortedList 
{
   ....

};
#endif

</xmp>
<br>
Make "ItemType" an alias of the type "BookType".
<p>

<li>Write the client program to read the book records from the data file one record at a time. 
Once the values of one book is read, insert it into the list of books.
Repeat this until the end of the data file is reached or the capacity of the list is reached.
<br>Hint: This is the same data file we discussed in this example:
<a href=../../private/code/review/31-struct-sort.cpp target=new>link to program code</a>. 
<p>
To download the data file into the project directory, use this command: <br>
<b>cp ~cen/data/books.dat  codelite-workspace-folder/project-folder/. </b>
<br>
<xmp>
int size=0;
BookType aBook;
while (size < MAX_SIZE && getline(myIn, aBook.title)) {

		getline(myIn, aBook.author);

		myIn >> aBook.publicationYear;
		myIn.ignore(100, '\n');

		// You are required add code below 
                // to add the book into the list and update "size"


}
</xmp>
<p>
<li>After the books are read from the data file, and inserted/added to the list, display the books one by one as shown below.
<p>
<li>Prompt the user to enter the name of an author, display only the books written by this author.
<br>Here is the program logic for the client program:
<xmp>
// First, add code here to "reset" the iterator for the list object

// Then, apply a "for" loop to go through the entire list item by item:
{
   // First, retrieve the next item

   // Then, check to see if this item has the author name matches with the author name entered by the user

         // If the name matches, display the information about the book 

}

</xmp>
</ol>

<p>
<h2>What to submit?</h2>
For this lab, you need to submit : <em>slist.h, slist.cpp, main.cpp</em>.
<p>
<h2>Steps to edit, compile, run, and submit the program:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If after you compile your program, there is compilation errors, then you need to modify the program according to the error messages. 
You may need to edit and compile your program multiple times before it compiles successfully.

<li>Now you can run the program, check to make sure the output is correct. If not, you need to modify the program and recompile and rerun the program.

<li>Once you are able to successfully run the program with the correct outputs, you are ready to submit the program electronically. Only submit the source file. 

Locate the source file in your "project" directory under your "workspace" directory. 
For example, if you named your "workspace" as "codelite" under your home directory, and named the project "CLA17", then "slist.h", "slist.cpp" and "main.cpp" should be in ~/codelite/CLA17 directory.
