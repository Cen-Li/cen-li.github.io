<h2>Programming Problem </h2>

Write a C++ program named <font color=red>"coin.cpp"</font>
that simulates flipping a coin repeatedly and continues until
three consecutive heads are tossed. At that point, your program should display the total
number of coin flips that were made. Use rand() function to simulate random toss of the coin.
Here are a few example runs of the program:

<p> Sample run 1
<xmp>
Head
Tail
Tail
Head
Head
Tail
Head
Tail
Head
Head
Head
It took 11 flips to get 3 consecutive heads.
</xmp>
<hr>

<p> Sample run 2
<xmp> 
Tail
Head
Tail
Tail
Tail
Tail
Head
Head
Tail
Head
Tail
Head
Head
Tail
Tail
Head
Head
Head
It took 18 flips to get 3 consecutive heads.
</xmp>
<hr>

<h2>About Random Number Generation</h2>
<ul>
<li><font color=red>How to generate random numbers in C++?</font></li>
The function rand() produces a random integer number in the range between 0 and RAND_MAX (a constant defined to be the largest integer value). 
The function is defined in cstdlib header file, so include it in your program:
<xmp>
#include <cstdlib>
</xmp>

<li>
<font color=red>How to make your program generate a different random sequence of toss each time you run the program?</font>
The function rand() generates pesudo random numbers based on a seed value. If we provide a different seed value each time we ran the program, then the sequence of random values generated on each run will be different. 
To do this, we are going to supply the seed value as the result of the function call "time(0)". The function call returns the number of seconds elapsed since Jan 1st, 1970. This number is going to be different each time we run the program, therefore a good random seed value to use.
The function "time" is defined in a special header file, so include it in your program as:
<xmp>
#include <ctime>
</xmp>
<br>
To tell the program to use time(0) value of the seed, we supply this value as the parameter
of the function srand(), (seeding for random number generator), like this:
<xmp>
srand(time(0));
</xmp>
<br>
<font color=blue>
It is important that we put this line as the first statement in the main function, right after the local variable declarations.</font>
</ul>

<h2>What to Submit for this part of the lab:</h2>

Create a script file with the steps shown below.
<xmp>
script  log4B
pr -n -t -e4 coin.cpp
c++ coin.cpp -o run
run
exit
</xmp>
<p>
These steps creates the script file named log4B. <br><p>
<li>
Submit the program with the "handin" command shown below:
<br>
<font color=red>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp handin lab4B coin.cpp log4B
</font>
<br><p>
(<b>Note: the name of the program needs to match the required file name exactly for submission to be successful.</b>)
