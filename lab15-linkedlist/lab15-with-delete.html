Lab 15 -- Learning C++ Unsorted Linked List
      </h1>
      </center>


<p>
In this lab, we will practice coding unsorted linked list. 
For this lab, we are not going to use a C++ class. We will focus on getting familiar with linked list operations without additional concerns about developing a C++ class.
The linked list will be developed entirely in the client program. 
<p>

This program reads in a number of values from the data file and inserts the items into an unsorted list using the insertion location provided for each item.
The format of the data file is as the following:

<xmp>
apple 
orange
pineapple
milk
...
</xmp>
<p>
Copy the data file with the following command: cp ~cen/data/grocery.dat  workspace-directory/project-directory/.


<p>
Write a client program with the following components:

<xmp>
// fill in the blank area 
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cassert>
using namespace std;

typedef string ItemType;
struct NodeType;            // forward declaration
typedef NodeType* NodePtr;

struct NodeType {
   ItemType data;
   NodePtr next;
};

// Declare the function "BuildList" here


// Declare the function "DisplayList" here


// Declare the function "IsPresent" here


// Declare the function "Delete" here


int main()
{
    ifstream myIn;
    NodePtr  head;  // the pointer points to the beginning of the list
    
    myIn.open("../grocery.dat");
    assert(myIn);

    // call the function "BuildList" to read data from the data file and construct the list


    // call the function "DisplayList" to display the list


    //cout << "Enter an item to be deleted from the list"
    // call the function "IsPresent" to determine if the item is in the list
    // If the item is in the list, 
    //              call the function "Delete" to delete the item from the list
    //              call the function "DisplayList" to display the list after the deletion
    // else
    //     display a message "The item is not found in the list

    myIn.close();

    return 0;
}

// Define the function "BuildList" here. 
// Write a "while" loop to read items from the data file, one item at a time.
// For each item read, add it at the end of the list.
// The loop terminates when the end of the data file is reached.






// Define the function "DisplayList" here.





// Define the function "IsPresent" here. This function returns true if the item to search for is 
// in the list, otherwise it returns false




// Define the function "Delete" here. This function deletes a value from  a list 




</xmp>

<h2>Test the program</h2>
Run the program 3 times. The first time, try deleting an item that is at the beginning of the list.
The second time, try deleting an item at the end of the list.
The third time, try deleting an item in the middle of the list.

<h2>What to Submit?</h2>
For this lab, you need to submit one file: <em>main.cpp</em>.
<p>
<h2>Steps to edit, compile, run, and submit the program:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If after you compile your program, there is compilation errors, then you need to modify the program according to the error messages. 
You may need to edit and compile your program multiple times before it compiles successfully.

<li>Now you can run the program, check to make sure the output is correct. If not, you need to modify the program and recompile and rerun the program.

<li>Once you are able to successfully run the program with the correct outputs, you are ready to submit the program electronically. Only submit the source file. 

Locate the source file in your "project" directory under your "workspace" directory. 
For example, if you named your "workspace" as "codelite" under your home directory, and named the project "cla15", then "main.cpp" should be in ~/codelite/cla15 directory.
